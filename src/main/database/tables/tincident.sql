With the fix it will, however, I could have text for both bronchitis and cough repeated.

The override pull appears as completed, but also does not display the administration. For the second linked administration (prednisone 20 mg), the administration information appears correctly on the pharmacy order with the icon indicating that it was linked to an override pull. Since the override pull for the second administration was linked correctly, the override pull no longer displays on the MAR.\r\nWorkflow 2:\r\nAn additional barcoding and linking medication workflow exists that may be confusing to an end user, which could result in medication administrations not being documented.  In this workflow the data is saved correctly, but the user may not realize that the medication administrations they started documenting on were not accepted and saved.  The workflow under which this occurs is as follows:\r\n1. Scan and documents multiple administrations without accepting\r\n2. Scan and select a pharmacy order which has a corresponding override pull\r\n3. On the linking form, change the selected Due time ? e.g., in this case change the selected Due time from 1640 to 1800 and click Accept\r\n4. When a Due time is changed, the user is returned to the MAR rather than continuing on to the MAR administration form.  The previous medications that were scanned and documented on are discarded as the user does not have the opportunity to accept the MAR administration form.  As expected, the MAR will continue to display these medications as ?Due? since the administrations were not accepted.  \r\nDuring this workflow, the end user may not realize that their previous medication administration information was not saved which could result in administrations not being documented on the MAR.\r\nAdhoc authorized by Bill Yee.\r\nConcern:  Administration for the medication is not visible on the MAR\r\nRisk Assignment Made by:   Dr. Scott Adelman\r\nProblem Discovered by:   Another Epic Client\r\nEpic Representative / email address:  Maria Spinozzi /mspinozz@epicsystems.com\r\nRemediation:   None.

There is no data corruption and no remediation required, it is a display issue. 9/8/08:  Issue has NOT been replicated (by Andre). Andre/Andrea to follow up with Bettianne. 9/11:  No alerts will be sent per Bettianne/Brian H, until issue replicated. Nov K-pckg seems reasonable.  9/18:  Per Andre, unable to replicate.  Andre to follow up with Epic (Chris R). 9/26:  per C. Russell,  Here?s where we stand.  There?re two different issues to test here: 1. Encounters may pull in I&O Net Since Admission values from previous, related encounters: This seemed to me to be easier to reproduce since it?s just linking encounters and documenting, but I have had no luck.  I?ve emailed the folks who raised this PSE to see if I am missing something. Linked encounters with I/O documented on the same date incorrectly calculate the Net Since Admission row: I created an HOV and admission for today and documented on them both.  The thing with this scenario is that you need to be able to scroll through the days in the I/O activity, so I will need to wait a few days since there is only one day to display at the moment. 10/13:  Dr. Bliss authorized adhoc.

Day 1\"s data is not visible on the screen).  \r\nSample Scenario:\r\nWhen this occurs, the I&O data from at least one of the visits may not be added correctly or may be calculated incorrectly, in the Net Since Admission total. \r\nOn Day 1 there were two related encounters with I&O documentation with a total intake of 8 ml.  On Day 2 an additional 4 ml is documented resulting in a Net Since Admission total of 12 ml. This total is accurately shown when the date range of Day 1 - Day 3 is selected.\r\nHowever, when the date range is changed to Day 2 - Day 3 (Day 1\"s data is not visible),  the Net Since Admission incorrectly shows the total as 8 ml for Day 2 instead of 12ml.  The total Net Since Admission, on Day 3 should be 16ml but the total displayed is only 12ml.\r\nNote:  This incident is virtually identical to an issue reported by EPIC 8/28/08 -  PART Incident #3710141.  This issue (#3731128) was discovered during additional testing for the previous issue (#3710141).  The critical difference is that issue #3710141 displayed inaccurate information by totaling previously documented I/O data, for episodes of related encounters, that would appear to be the total for the current day of the current admission.

After an IV fluid bag is scanned, the volume of the IV bag is displayed on the MAR as the rate for the IV fluid.

',' Fall\"04-SP\"07 (Beacon) - First dose scheduling for Treatment Plan Orders using Specified frequencies may not be respected\r\n\"Detail Description:  A Treatment Plan order can be configured with a first dose based on the released time (include now) or based on the frequency scheduled times.  If specified frequencies are used, when released, the first scheduled instance/dose setting (EFQ 150) from the frequency will be respected instead of the order setting.  The total doses will remain accurate, but the schedule times will unexpectedly change when the order is released.\r\nFor example, an order in a Treatment Plan has a scheduled frequency of Daily at 7:00AM for 4 doses.  The Daily at 7:00AM specified frequency is configured with a first scheduled instance based on the scheduled time (not Include Now).  On Wednesday at 7:45AM a user changes the order to \"\"Include Now\"\" and signs the order, which changes the scheduled occurrences to Wednesday 7:45AM, Thursday 7:00AM, Friday 7:00AM, and Saturday 7:00AM.  Normally, even if the order was released at a later time such as Wednesday 11:00AM, since Include Now was selected, the first scheduled dose would start at the release time of Wednesday 11:00AM.\r\nDue to this issue, when the order is released, the order scheduling will not respect the include now, and instead schedule based on the frequency setup to follow the scheduled time of 7:00AM.  As a result if the order is released Wednesday 7:45AM, the 4 doses will be scheduled at Thursday 7:00AM, Friday 7:00AM, Saturday 7:00AM, and Sunday 7:00 AM.\r\nIssue affects Santa Teresa (only) & there are 22 affected records. \r\nAdhoc authorization made by Dr. Bliss.\r\nConcern:  Treatment may be given at an incorrect time.\r\nRisk Assignment Made by:   Dr. Bob Dolin\r\nProblem Discovered by:   Another Epic Client\r\nRemediation:  None discussed\r\nAction items (immediate):  Workaround to be communicated\r\nAction items (future):   Epic will provide a fix (adhoc) ETA on April 2nd, 2008.  \r\n\"\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'3/20/08:  Affects-NCAL (Santa Teresa), SU\"05-SP\"07, Beacon.

The NCAL Bridges team was able to remediate 4 of those 6 charts.  The remaining 2 could not be immediately remediated because the remediation strategy required an editing of the original HL7 messages that came through the Interface Broker.  Messages are only retained for 30 days and those 2 messages went through the broker more than 30 days before the remediation.\r\nTo remediate the last 2 charts, NCAL would need copies of the messages sent by HMI, so that they could be reconstructed.  Those messages from HMI were not readily available in a format that our Bridges teams could use.\r\nJoe Dimiliar from the KP Online ISG group was working with HMI to obtain copies of those messages.  As of the beginning of last week, I don\"t believe they were available.  Joe would need to confirm the status of that effort.  Pending his response you may be able to 1) close the issue because remediation is complete, 2) close the issue because no further remediation is possible, 3) leave it open pending delivery of the messages from HMI and completion of the work by the Bridges team.  If HMI can deliver the messages the Bridges team should be able to complete the work rather quickly.Joe-  can you confirm where this currently stands?\r\nPER Joe DiMilia,Byron, this is an excellent summary.\r\nThe only clarification I would add is:\r\nNCAL was able to remediate 4 of the 6 charts because the messages were less than 30 days old.  This allowed them to access the original HL7 messages directly from their Regional Interface Broker.\r\nNeither the Regional Interface Broker or the National Intergration Borker (which sends receives the messages from HMI and sends them to each region) stores these messages beyond 30 days.\r\nHMI did retreive and resend the original messages for NCAL for both messages oder than 30 days, but they are in XML format.  (This is the standard format for sending PHI through a secure VPN connection over the internet.)\r\nNCAL cannot use the older messages in XML format unless we can resend them through the Integration Broker to get them translated to HL7.\r\nHere is my status report:\r\nI am actively pursuing several ideas to close this issue for these 2 messages:\r\nRun both messages through our test environment so the Integration Broker can translate them to HL7\r\nResend both message through production.\r\n#1 would require exposing PHI in testing, so we would need compliance approval and will take more time to implement (simply to set up the testing accounts to mirror the appropriate production users attributes).\r\n#2 runs the risk of creating a duplicate encounter, so we need to research and act carefully to ensure that the messages would error out, if we pursue this route.\r\nI will be working with testing environment and HMI technical contacts to explore both options.\r\nI expect to have a recommendation by end of week.  In the meantime, I welcome any other simpler (less risky) options.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,140,141,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2008-11-11 10:06:00','2009-05-29 11:43:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(215,3940553,1,'INPAT',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,'SP07 - Medication Reconciliation - PTA medications may not appear in Medication Activity if Sig contains line breaks',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'AMB, ED, Beacon, Rx','','',NULL,NULL,'2008-11-13 00:00:00',NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,'Dr. Peter Dwork',NULL,NULL,'','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'SCAL to adhoc','1205-PS-PR3940553-C75031213-E757868-Spr07Jan19NS.tar.Z','K011909',NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','N','N','C',NULL,'N',NULL,'Z',NULL,'5',NULL,NULL,'MedRec','N','S','R','B',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'N','Y','Y','Y','N','Y','N','Y','N',NULL,NULL,NULL,'N','Y','N',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'NOTES:  E confirmed in K011909\nDLG NUMBER(S):  \n  I7511095\nAD HOC DELIVERED (AUTH # 4510):  \n  SP’07 C75031213 12/05/085\nKPACKAGE DELIVERED:  \n  SP’07 K011908\nRISK RANKING:  5',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'code ifx was installed on 2/21/09 and validated successfully by Trudy David Inpatient  ','Orders may be cancelled in the new order reconciliation discharge navigator when they are intended to be signed or signed & held.

A submitted signed order will appear as if one order is placed multiple times with different order details.\r\n A physician may sign off on procedure or medication orders and not know that multiple orders are being submitted and that the orders may be duplicated or corrupted. \r\n\r\nTo be affected, the following conditions all need to apply:\r\n1.	UCW (Unified Clinical Workspace) is not turned on\r\n2.	ED and IP application modules must be licensed and in use\r\n3.	Users who access the patient while the patient is still in the ED and are allowed to place orders must have access to activities that are not allowed in the IP_ED workspace kind\r\n\r\nSample workflow:\r\n1. Open an encounter for a patient in the ED\r\n2. Write orders in the first workspace\r\n3. Open an activity that is not allowed in the IP_ED workspace kind (e.g. Inpt Rounding Navigator, IP Admission Navigator,\r\n    IP Discharge Navigator, etc.).

If orders are entered in one workspace, they will inadvertently exist in both workspaces at the same time.  When the user signs the orders in one of the workspaces, the orders from the other workspace are signed as well, even though the additional orders are not seen in the signing workspace.  If the user then goes to the other workspace and signs those orders, which are still displayed in hyperspace and which may also contain completely different orders, a second set of duplicate but corrupt order records may be created.  Example: Multiple medication orders may display with a different medication display name than what was originally ordered (e.g. Furosemide, but with Sigs for other ordered medications (Furosemide 2.5 mg Oral, Daily, and Furosemide 20 units Subcutaneous at Bedtime [instead of Insulin], and Furosemide 25 mg Oral, BID, [instead of Metropolol], etc.)  \r\n',NULL,NULL,'',NULL,'12/13/09: Per 12/8 PS meeting, Andre to see if w/a needs to be reversed/undone.\r\n12/02/09: Per A.

Soriano verified successful install of the fix for this issue. ','Medication and procedure filtered system lists may exclude patients incorrectly for the following problems. The pharmacy workflow uses these filtered lists to identify which patients may need closer monitoring (e.g. warfarin protocol). Patients may be missing from these lists in the following 3 problem scenarios:\r\n1) Medication and procedure orders placed on pre-admitted patients are not evaluated and added to system lists when the patients are admitted.  Pre-admit med orders will be added to the system lists correctly, after they are verified by a pharmacist, which is the typical workflow. However, pre-admit procedure orders may not be added. An example of this procedure order would be a consult or system list filter for patients with particular xray procedure ordered (these procedures areusually a consult or ancillary type of procedure and are not generally clinically invasive types of procedures such as placement of a chest tube, central line, or wound debridement). If a region uses procedure orders instead of medication orders to monitor patients (ex. Warfarin Protocol), then a region may be impacted. (The value in LSD item 34804)\r\n 2) Patients with Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) and mixture orders might be removed from a system list incorrectly and this may occur after a system list filter is either viewed or edited. These screens are accessed from d ^L > Management Options > Edit System Definitions > Patient List. Users  must use F6 to edit a filter (see below-Edit System List Filters), although one need not change anything about the filter to be affected. A region may be affected, if a user used any of the medication related filter options. (Value in system definitions 34811, 34813, 34831). As clarification regarding this error caused by \"viewing\"- text screens in Chronicles may be entered in edit mode or view mode.  This error can occur if the screen is entered in edit mode without changes being made.  In this case the screen has been \"viewed\".  If the screen is entered in view mode, however, the error does not occur.\r\n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  Edit System List Filters  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\r\n Filter value: DEXTROSE\r\n Medications               Therapeutic Classes       Pharmaceutical Classes   \r\n 1. 46245-DEXTROSE\r\n 2. Procedures                Order Types               Procedure Categories     \r\n Note: When the values of a filter are changed, patients with existing orders matching the filter are automatically added to system lists.  If needed, one may run \"d RebuildAdm^JCNMED1()\" from the Cache prompt to rebuild all the lists.Example:An order is placed for a TPN that has dextrose. The dextrose ERX is included in the \"DEXTROSE\" system list filter, because you want to know all patients with orders for this medication. After this order is placed, the patient appears on the patient list. Then someone on the technical team forgets what the particular dextrose system list filter contains, so they enter the record in System Definitions on the text side. Upon exiting, only the TPN ERX record is evaluated for the group \"DEXTROSE\", which it does not have, so the order and patient fall off of the system list. Instead, both the TPN ERX record and its components should be evaluated for the filter.\r\n3) Only affects version SP\"08.  Orders using med grouper items 2-6 might be removed from a system list incorrectly. As with #2 above, this happens after a system list filter is accessed on the text side. You also must edit a filter to be affected.  If you use a filter based on the ERX grouper items 2-6 (ERX items 4110 , 4120, 4130, 4140, and 4150), when you access the following screen in System Definitions (this is the 2nd screen of the Filter definitions), all orders that would otherwise match the grouper criteria, will be removed from the system list based on the filter.

Even though the results are filed correctly to the patient chart, improper configuration or system build has the potential to cause a result notification not to be generated for all intended recipients. Although there are legitimate cases where a region may choose not to route a result notification to any provider, EPIC has identified that occasionally no notification is being sent due to improper configuration, improper use, or accidental omission of certain results routing rules or settings. \r\nBased on their recent customer experience, Epic has identified configuration areas that have a higher potential of incorrect setup or build. Over the next few days, Epic will run search utilities to check for known areas of problem configuration and formulate region specific action plans to address those areas as needed. Regional EPIC TS\"s will review the results of the searches with each region and assist each region with necessary setup changes. The configuration areas that have been identified and will be the focus in this escalation are: \r\na) Regional current build configurationvs. what Epic recommends - There may be regional build variations that should be reviewed against build recommendations suggested by EPIC.  Current regional build decisions may have valid justification but should be reviewed to determine if changes are warranted based on desired workflow or process.\r\nUser set-up configuration - EPIC queries will identify specific provider profiles that may require set-up configuration changes to enable receipt of In Basket results.\r\n\r\nc) Orders and In Basket Configuration - Specific orders and In Basket configurations that result in messages not being generated will be identified in the EPIC queries and should be reviewed.\r\nd) Pool back up set-up configuration ? Examples of this area would be: 1) a results routing scheme is improperly configured to only send results to a staff pool that has been marked inactive or doesn?t have any members, results sent through this scheme would not reach a recipient. or 2)  a clinic in a region schedules resident appointments using a generic resource for the purpose of working from one common schedule and uses results routing schemes that only send to the encounter provider, results will only be sent to the generic resource.\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'4/13: David O. to f/up with Johnette.\r\nJohnette to check w/ Jansin if OK to close this issue.

The administration rounding factor is used for simple meds (a medication that is just one medication).

Medication records can be \"marked\" by FDB as \"Unassociated\", \"Split\", or \"Replacement\". \r\n\r\n1) Unassociated Records ? According to FDB, any real medications should not be marked as ?Unassociated.?  Unassociated medications are normally items such as shampoo, supplies, etc.  However, Epic has found real FDB medication records marked as ?Unassociated?.  Epic assumes that FDB meant to mark them as \"Replacement\" or \"Split\". \r\n\r\nWith the changes Epic made in SP\'07: I759326 - E757940, I759822 - E756905 and SP\'08: I765903 - E760749, when an allergen gets updated in an FDB load, Epic code will remove the medications from drug type allergen records that are marked as ?Unassociated? because the meds are no longer associated with the record. As a result that medication won?t fire against the allergen with which it was previously associated.\r\n\r\nIn this case, Epic can identify the allergen that is a problem. However, Epic can\'t identify which medications used to be associated with the allergen so that data can?t be provided.\r\n\r\n2) Replaced Records ? Sometimes FDB marks medications as ?Replaced? or ?Split?. This means that a medication record is being replaced by one or other medication records.\r\n\r\nWith the changes we made in SP\'07: I759326 - E757940, I759822 - E756905 and SP\'08: I765903 - E760749, when an allergen gets updated in an FDB load, Epic code removes the meds from drug type allergen records that are marked as replaced, since the meds are no longer associated with the replaced record. Since Epic code currently isn\'t looking at the replacement file, Epic code will remove the medications from the allergen and not add back the medications that are the replacement. Thus a similar Problem 2 will arise, as in Problem 1, where a patient has an allergen documented and an allergy alert won\'t fire for a specific med.\r\n \r\nIn this case, Epic can identify the allergen that is a problem and provide a replacement suggestion of which allergens the region should be using instead. Epic can also tell if a patient is currently allergic to one of the meds on their profile where the alert didn?t fire. \r\n\r\nThe numbers of affected patient charts identified by region with affected ELG records and active medication orders are:   SCAL: 67, NCAL: 43,  CO: 3, NW: 12, HI: 0, MAS: 0, OH: 0, GA: 5\r\n\r\nNote:  Until special updates are developed and installed, regions may continue to have affected allergens identified on this search, after each FDB load occurs. FDB is working to correct their data to insure all clinically relevant changes are in the replacement file. However, until Epic has the SU\'s developed, more affected records may be introduced by the FDB load.\r\n',NULL,NULL,'',NULL,'09/02/09: per Syliva Fong, Rx meeting again with FDB in late Sept; will get a better idea of the eta.

Leaving open as PS until this is complete.   7/14:  Technically, the issue is fixed; however, KP does not have a way to clean up (replace) old/bad allergens with good allergens.  Each region is now forced to manually fix patient records each time FDB updates the ELG (allergen) master file.   \r\n7/14:  per BYee, each region still needs to continue to work with their own Epic TS to run reports on affected patient allergy profiles; NCAL had 0 patients, SCAL had 7.7/7: May K pckg (and fix) installed into NATLNAM on 6/27.  Checking w. Bill Yee if OK to close. 5/29/09:  per BYee The fix is delivered, tested and in the May K package.  This will be installed into NATLNAM on 6/27/09.

Most consisted of topicals and birth control pills. Either those meds have been discontinued on the outpatient basis, switched to something else, or the patient has not picked up a refill in quite some time.  Rx does not need a physician for NCAL.  Per B. Yee:  Our pharmacists will manually review these charts and then if needed, work with a regional physician (identified by PART rotation) to determine if any remediation is needed.

This will result in the patient having two active orders for the same medication: the original PTA medication and the modified medication. The affected workflow involves signing and holding a modified PTA med order in one med rec session and subsequently modifying and signing the same PTA med order in another med rec session. \r\n \r\nThe affected workflow is as follows:\r\n1.  Open the medication reconciliation from the discharge navigator\r\n2.	Go to the Reconcile Medications for Discharge tab\r\n3.	Click ?Modify? next to one of the home medications and change one of the order properties\r\n4.	Accept the order and move to the Review and Sign step of med rec\r\n5.	Click ?Sign & Hold? next to the newly-modified discharge order and finish the med rec process\r\n6.	Open the discharge med rec navigator a second time\r\n7.	Click the ?Edit? hyperlink next to the home medication that you modified previously\r\n8.	Change a property of the of the order, accept your changes, and move to Review and Sign\r\n9.	Click ?Sign? next to your modified order and complete the med rec process\r\n10. Go to the Patient Summary activity and view the Discharge Summary Report. In the ?Home Medications? print group, you will see that there are two instances of the order you modified.\r\n\r\nSmartLinks that pull discharge medication data and Print Groups and Reports that display this data will also be affected.

','When creating user order sets a user may override an order template\'s frequency. After the PRL conversion has been completed, if a user creates a user order set and changes an order frequency from a \"when\" type frequency ( \"when\" type = once or one time dose) to a multiple occurrence frequency (BID, TID, QID, etc.), in one or more of the orders, the composer displays additional fields that allow users to specify the number of occurrences. If the user doesn\'t specify either a number of occurrences or number of doses to be administered the order template record will be saved with 1 occurrence (1 dose or 1 time). As a result, the user may incorrectly assume that when submitting the order, that has been changed in the order set, the order will be placed as Until Specified (administered or performed indefinitely until the order is changed or discontinued).  This issue applies to both procedure and medication orders that include a \"when\" type frequency. Additionally, for medication orders, if the number of occurences is not changed and is saved as 1 occurance, the order status on the MAR will change to Completed, once a dose is administered and documented on the MAR.\r\nExample Workflow\r\n1.Open a patient hospital encounter and go to the Order Set activity (Action > Order Set)\r\n2.Select an order set that has at least one order with a \"once\" or other \"when\"-type frequency in it.\r\n3.Go to \"Manage User Order Sets\" and create a new user order set.\r\n4.Override one of the one-time orders and change the frequency to any scheduled or non-scheduled type frequency (PRN, daily, Q4H, etc.).\r\n5.Do notchange the number of doses/occurrences or the type of count (hours, days). Notice that it appears blank in the user order set editor, implying ?until specified? or ?until discontinued.?\r\n6.Accept the changes to the order and the user order set.\r\n7.Look at the resulting order in the order set. If the frequency is in the summary sentence, it will display \"1 dose\" or \"1 occurrence.\" In the order composer, the dose/occurrence fields will display 1 dose/occurrence.\r\n8.If the order is placed, it will have a dose/occurrence count of one.\r\n',NULL,NULL,'',NULL,'08/18/09: Confirm with S.

As a result, LQH records in the History Visit Navigator section may contain updated EDG records such that, when LQH questions are used for documenting Medical History, incorrect or inaccurate history data may be associated with an incorrect diagnosis and incorrect information may display in History Print Groups in reports.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, when the ICD-9 Update Utility runs, the update utility will add to the LQH record all EDG records with an ICD-9 code that matches that of any of the EDG records that are already a part of the LQH record. EDG diagnosis records in an LQH (as well as LGL and HMT) record may incorrectly or unintentionally be added to the LQH record.  \r\n\r\nBecause the ICD-9 code assigned to non-reference diagnosis records can change over time, it is possible that the list of ICD-9 codes for diagnosis records may \"drift\" over time. These EDG records may then manifest an \"ICD 9 drift\", when routine update and propagation of new or different EDG records by the CMT team occurs (generally on a yearly basis). Subsequent documentation using questions in the LQH record may then file to an inappropriate diagnosis and be displayed in History Print Groups which could indicate that a patient has a condition that they do not have.\r\n \r\nFor example: an LQH record that was originally built using a BPH (Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy) diagnosis record, as the Affirmative Diagnosis (item 430 in the LQH record),  may be updated to include a Subphrenic Abscess After Surgery diagnosis (EDG) record.  Documentation using questions for a diagnosis of BPH may now be associated with a diagnosis of Subphrenic Abscess After Surgery.\r\n\r\nNote:  EDG records, identified in EPIC queries as having the ICD-9 drift, generally demonstrated only a slight variation, which is usually from more general to more specific, within the correct \"EDG Family\".  In this case,  grossly inaccurate History information would not occur .  \r\n\r\nThere are, however, some examples of drift in the queries that are questionable and require further analysis.  For example, further analysis has shown that the BPH to Subphrenic Abscess association noted above may have been due to builder error rather than ICD-9 drift.  However, EPIC is recommending to all customers to migrate to the use of VCG groups rather than discrete diagnoses in the Affirmative Diagnosis field of the LQH record.',NULL,NULL,'',NULL,'09/29/09: AMB checking if utility needs to be run.

To be impacted, a region must allow clinicians to modify a signed facility-administered medication without discontinuing the original order.  \r\nSpecifically, this issue does not occur if the Allowed Medication Modifications field in EMR System Definitions, which controls this feature, is blank.  NOTE: Beacon treatment plans and simple treatment plans are impacted: \r\nThe issue may occur in either of the following two workflows:\r\n1. The order appears in the treatment plan with the modifications and a note that the order reflects post-release modifications. However, the modifications have not been finalized and should not appear in the treatment plan until the pended order is signed or the held order is released.\r\n2. If the clinician removes the modifications, the original order appears in the treatment plan and the modifications are appropriately removed. However, the order appears as an unreleased order instead of a released order. A clinician can release the order again, which could result in the medication being administered twice to the patient if the clinician or other clinicians do not notice that two orders appear in the MAR for the same medication.\r\nExample:\r\n1. A patient arrives at the oncology infusion center for his/her chemotherapy infusion appointment.\r\n2. The nurse releases the patient?s treatment plan orders, including an order for a 10 mg Decadron injection.\r\n3. Later, the oncologist decides to change the dose of the Decadron. He accesses the Medications activity, selects the Decadron order, and clicks Modify.\r\n4. After clicking modify, Order Entry automatically opens, and the order appears. The oncologist changes the dose to 20 mg and pends the order.\r\n5. In the treatment plan, the order appears with the modifications, even though the modifications have not been signed.\r\n6. The oncologist then decides to remove the modifications for the Decadron injection. He or she opens Order Entry and clicks the Remove button next to the pended order.\r\n7. The order now appears as unreleased in the treatment plan.

Santiago, ok to close, NCAL not affected.','Intelligent medication selection (IMS) is a process by which EpicCare selects the most appropriate medication strength to order, based on the dose. For example, upon ordering, IMS may change a medication?s sig from ?two 10 mg pills daily? to ?one 20 mg tablet daily.?  When IMS is implemented, IMS will be active for refilled prescriptions as well as those placed at discharge\r\nIMS and refilled prescriptions\r\nIf dose changes in refills of existing medications are not adequately communicated, a  patient might not realize that the strength has changed and continue to take two tablets of a prior strength when the correct sig is now one tablet daily.  \r\nExample: \r\nA patient requests a refill of a prescription for Lipitor (80 mg total/day taken in two 40mg tablets).\r\nThe provider refills the order for a daily dose of two 40 mg tablets to be taken once a day, as before.\r\nIMS will replace the two 40 mg tablets with one 80 mg tablet to be taken once a day, as designed. \r\nHowever, if the patient is used to taking two tablets and continues to do so without realizing that the per-tablet strength is higher, patient care could be impacted.\r\nIMS and discharge workflows\r\nIn hospital discharge workflows, a physician may order a medication and then modify its dose before patient discharge and medication dispensation. Any modified medications are identified as changed in the patient?s discharge report, and the patient should be counseled about the changes before leaving the hospital. However, if a PTA medication order is modified at discharge, the patient might not realize that the strength has changed and continue to take two tablets of a prior strength when the correct sig is now one tablet daily.\r\nIn discharge workflows, IMS functions as follows: \r\nIMS substitution can occur when a prior-to-admission medication is ordered upon admission. If IMS substitutes a product with a different strength upon admission, the new product might be prescribed upon discharge. \r\nIMS substitution can also occur when a prior-to-admission medication is reordered or modified upon discharge or when a new drug is ordered during the admission and ordered as a prescription upon discharge. \r\nIMS does not occur when a prior-to-admission medication is simply resumed, because a new order is not placed in this situation. \r\nExample: \r\nOn discharge a prescription for Lipitor (40 mg total/day taken in two 20mg tablets) is modified to 80 mg total/day taken in two 40 mg tablets\r\nThe provider submits the order for a daily dose of 80 mg total/day taken in two 40 mg tablets to be taken once a day.\r\nIMS will replace the two 40 mg tablets with one 80 mg tablet to be taken once a day, as currently designed. \r\nHowever, if the patient is used to taking two tablets and continues to do so without realizing that the per-tablet strength is higher, patient care could be impacted.\r\n',NULL,NULL,'',NULL,'09/28/09: July KPKG, 11/09 install.\r\n5/13:  forward PART email to Johnette (AMB), BYee (Rx)','NCI','','NCI',NULL,' IMS has not currently been implemented in any KP region but may be implemented after installation of the SU\'09 release.

To ensure that only Extended View can be accessed, configure the clinicians\' profiles as follows:\r\nIn Clinical Administration, select Management Options > Profiles (LPR).\r\nOpen your profile and select Lab, Result.\r\nOn the Results Review screen, enter Latest Results View and Condensed View in the Results Review views to hide field.\r\nShow all existing values for a result component in Hyperspace\r\nConfigure the following affected areas of Hyperspace so that they display all of the existing values for a result component. This configuration ensures that all of the values appear when multiple values are filed at the same instant. \r\nUtilize mnemonics:  SmartLinks 13, 55, 56, 61, 63, 168, and 169 each can use a mnemonic to display all values for a result component. The mnemonic must be added in the in the following format: [<result component basename>:*. For example, if you want to display all values for a WBC component and you are using SmartLink 61, your SmartLink should appear as such: .LASTLAB[WBC:*. You can also use a comma-delimited list to specify multiple result components in the mnemonic. For example, [WBC:*,RBC:*. This mnemonic can be added to the SmartLink on-the-fly, or it can be added when the SmartLink is used in another SmartTool, such as a SmartText or SmartPhrase. \r\nUtilize print groups: Print groups 55629 and 15023 each have a parameter that can be set so that the print group displays all values for a result component. Specify a result component in the first parameter of print group 55629 or the second parameter of print group 15023 in the following format: <result component basename>:*. For example, WBC:*. You can use a comma-delimited list to specify multiple result components in the parameter.

Dorcia Hart is forwarding this information with the attached search results to those teams for their analysis and response. \r\nPlease check with your regional Pharmacy Clinical Content team (who modify orders in Base Order Sets) after they have analyzed the additional information to determine if there is further impact or any need for remediation of Base Order Sets or User OrderSets.\r\nNew Information from Epic (Peter Lesperance):\r\nEpic has discovered another scenario that can cause the same issue reported in PR 4709807. The issue reported to PART involved changes to the ERX record subsequent to a user creating a user order set involving that ERX. The new scenario involves changes made to the base order set subsequent to a user creating a user order set.\r\nNew Scenario:\r\nA base order set is created with or without defaults for the two affected item pairs (dose/unit and occurrence/type). For example, a base order set is created with an Aspirin order with a dose/unit of 81 mg.\r\nA user creates an override for this base order set and changes one item in an item pair, but not the other. For example, the user changes the Aspirin dose to 160 mg. This will be compiled correctly initially.\r\nAn administrator modifies the base order set and changes the dose/unit to 1 Tab for the Aspirin order. This triggers a recompile of affected user order sets. Because the user order set in this scenario changed the dose but not the unit, the new compiled OTL will take the dose from the user order set (160) but take the unit from the base order set (Tab), resulting in an incorrect dose of 160 Tab.\r\nUpdated OTL search results that identify Order Sets impacted by this newly identified scenario are attached to this email. These results include the user order sets that might be affected by changes to base order sets. \r\nPlease note that there are results for NW and each deployment in NCAL and SCAL.

Although KP does not use Contact Mover in standalone mode, it unmerges records as needed and is thus is affected by Contact Mover. \r\n\r\nEpic has identified fourteen different issues related to Contact Mover and possibly the unmerge functionality.  All are issues that relate to whether the right information reaches the correct unmerged, separated records. The issues are:\r\n1. Allergies Remain on the Source Patient Record and Are Not Moved to Target Patient Record. This can impact allergies added while the patient records were merged.\r\n2. Problem List Problems Remain on the Source Patient Record and Are Not Moved to Target Patient Record. This can impact Problem List items added while the patient records were merged.\r\n3. Immunizations Remain on the Source Patient Record and Are Not Moved to Target Patient Record. This can impact immunization items added while the patient records were merged.\r\n4. Overlay Resolution Report Doesn?t Indicate That Outpatient Medication and Procedure Orders Are Discontinued When Moved to the Target Patient Record.  The Source patient would need to have the medication or procedure order prior to the merge. The records would then need to be unmerged.  It is important to review the medications on both the Source record and Target record. as well as checking the Overlay Review Report.\r\n5. Outpatient Prescriptions for Source Patient Record Might Be Incorrectly Discontinued During Contact Move. The Source patient would need to have the medication or procedure order prior to the merge. The records would then need to be unmerged.  It is important to review the medications on both the Source record and Target record. as well as checking the Overlay Review Report.\r\n6. Actions Taken for the Source Patient Based on In Basket Messages Are Not Voided When the Contact Is Moved The In Basket message would have to have been on the Source patient prior to the merge.  The action on this message would need to have occurred post-merge.  When the unmerge occurs, it is important to check the In Basket message and data in the both the Target and Source record to determine if a problem occurred.\r\n7. Incorrect Order Information Appears in Treatment Plans. The treatment plan would need to exist on the Source record prior to the merge.  The associated orders would need to be released while the records were merged.  After unmerging, check the Source record to see if orders are still released when this treatment plan is moved back to the restored record.\r\n8. Changes Made to a Treatment Plan Remain on the Source Patient Record and Are Not Moved to the Target Patient Record. The treatment plan would need to exist on the Source record prior to the merge.  Changes would need to be made while the records were merged.  After unmerging, it is important to check both the Source and Target records to see which record has the changed info in the treatment plan.  \r\n9. Mammography Letters Can Be Sent to the Wrong Patient. This may occur if the letter was sent while records were merged.\r\n10. Mammography Recommendations Resolved for Wrong Patient.  This may occur if the documentation occurred on an encounter from the Source patient after the records were merged.  After unmerge, it is important to check data in both Target and Source records.\r\n11. Documented Implants Remain on the Source Patient Record and Are Not Moved to the Target Patient Record.  For this to occur, the documentation would need to be on the encounter from the original Source patient.  Documentation would need to have occurred after the merge.  Both Target and Source records should be checked after the unmerge.\r\n12. Anticoagulation Information Remains on the Source Patient Record and Is Not Moved to the Target Patient Record.

The process is to review both the Target and Source Records after the unmerge to ensure that each record has the correct data (allergies, immunizations, encounters, appointments, PCP, etc).    \r\nThe current worklow is:\r\nAfter the unmerge, review the Overlay Detection Report.\r\nEnsure that all items are accounted for on the \"restored\" target and \"restored\" source records after the unmerge.  \r\nAny items listed on the \"pre-unmerged\" record (i.e., items added while records were merged) should be manually added back to the correct patient record.\r\nAll regions (NCAL, SCAL, NW,  HI, CO/Exempla, MAS, GA, and OH) continuie to implement the workaround.\r\nRegions may refer to the above list of issues for more information on specific workaround suggestions, and take action as they see necessary.','Epic (Brandon Podoll) is running searches to determine if regions have currently affected records, and will send search results to Identify AC Diane Arterberry who will review and then forward to appropriate regions.\r\nRegions should work with their Epic TS to review and interpret the searches for degree of potential impact.\r\n','',NULL,'Risk assessment by Dr. Andy Weisenthal\r\nDiscovered by Epic',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,141,274,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-11-03 03:58:00','2009-11-13 01:52:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(398,4961781,1,'OTH',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,'NO CURRENT IMPACT - IntraConnect - Chart Synchronization might not synchronize some linked records','','',NULL,NULL,'IntraConnect',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-11-05 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,'','Robert Shimmin',NULL,'',NULL,'','','','','','','Jan 2010 K-pckg','','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'O','NA',NULL,NULL,'0',NULL,'0',NULL,NULL,'NOV09','N','N','N','N',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'N','Y','Y',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'EPIC CODE STATUS DUE:  11/23/09 (RS)\nNOTES:  SU09 fix expected in Dec, SP07 fix Jan 15--both in Jan Kpackage or IU\nDLG NUMBER(S):  \n  SP07 I7513375 SU09  I7702875\nKPACKAGE EXPECTED',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'11/9:  per R.

Note: The order is not actually linked to Patient 2 in Chronicles, so Patient 2?s record will not be affected. The incorrect association instead affects how chart synchronization handles the data for Patient 1. \r\nD-C requests Patient 1?s chart from its home, D-A. Because the order record has been unintentionally unlinked in step 3 above, Patient 1?s chart might synchronize to D-C without the order record.

This template is not the default I/O template itself, but a separate template designed to group several I/O rows of similar type together for convenience.\r\nDocument on one of these I/O rows.  Note: The row in this separate template should not be listed as part of the default I/O template itself, and should be a non-duplicable row (meaning that it cannot be copied).  The data on this row must be entered immediately after the LDA documentation in step 2.\r\nGo to the default I/O template, Flowsheet C, and notice that the row you just documented on has been added to the I/O template.  \r\nIn this same row, file some additional data in the row.\r\nNotice that the data has disappeared from the row where you attempted to file it.

This occurs  if both of the following conditions are true:\r\nBatch template record (E1A) 34100 is set up to print a report for each patient on a patient list.\r\nThe report contains a header print group that contains patient information such as patient\'s name, MRN, etc.\r\n\r\nFor example, the header print group on the second and all subsequent pages of a report, configured to use patient lists, may contain the name and MRN of the first patient on the list. If a page for the second patient or other patients on the patient list contains allergies or medication information for that patient, it may appear that the patient information for the second and consecutive patient names in a patient list could be associated with the first name on the list.    \r\nPrinting is server side.\r\nAt Kaiser, examples of printing using the batch template that meet these criteria could be patient letters (though currently Patient Lists are not implemented in Ambulatory implementations within KP) or MARs for Phase 1 or Phase 2 hospitals in current Inpatient implementations. \r\n\r\nUPDATE 12/10/09\r\nEpic (Shoba Selvarajan ) has informed us that there are now two variations of this incident that have been identified.  The first, is the original PART issue that was reported and discussed and it has no impact on any region. The second variation impacts only  NCAL, SCAL and CO. \r\n\r\nNO REGION IMPACTED BY THIS ISSUE: Issue #1 variation (QAN 840546)  ? Repeating header due to specific print groups\r\nWhen a batch job using template 34100 or 34500 generates certain reports, the header or footer for the first patient can repeat on every page.  As described below, this is dangerous because users might incorrectly think that clinical information from the body of a page corresponds to the patient identified in the header.  Reports containing print groups 54058, 54024, or 54014 (or copies thereof) in the body of the report that also uses a running header or footer print group (ie a print group that appears at the top or bottom of each printed page) will cause this issue.\r\nWorkaround: Do either of the following:\r\nRemove the running header from your report and replace it with a similar body print group OR \r\nReplace one of the affected body print groups with a similar print group. Affected body print groups are listed below along with some suggested replacements:\r\nLPG 54024 (affected) is similar to LPG 54088 (not affected)\r\nLPG 54014 (affected) is similar to LPG 54099 (not affected)\r\nLPG 54058 (affected) is somewhat similar to LPG 54011 (not affected) and/or LPG 54089 (not affected)\r\n	Fixes:  DLG 159385 fixes this issue in 2010.  SU\'09 fix I7701318 (E7701103) is released; SP\'07 SU is being developed.\r\n\r\nNCAL, SCAL, and CO impacted by Issue #2 variation (QAN 847572)  ? Mnemonic ?Split Report by Patient? can cause confusing headers in printed content\r\n	Description\r\nBatch job 34100 has a mnemonic called \"split report by patient.\"  When a job is configured to route reports to a printer this mnemonic behaves non-intuitively, suppressing page breaks between patients if it is set to yes.  If a job configured as such is also using a report with a running header or footer print group it can be hard to determine which information corresponds to which patient.  Information for multiple patients can appear on one page, and the header or footer will only display information for the first or last patient on the page, respectively.  It?s possible for a page to contain a header for patient A, and one line of information for patient A at the top, with the rest of the page containing information about patient B.  The effect is that the header for a given page displays information about a different patient than the body of the page.\r\n	NOTE: Jobs routing reports to BCA PCs are not affected.\r\nWorkaround: Always set \"split report by patient\" to\"no\" when routing to a printer.  This causes page breaks to occur between the end of one patient and the beginning of the next.\r\nFixes:  Page breaks will always be inserted between patients regardless of the value of \"split report by patient.\"  This fix is being developed in 2010 log 168714 and will be SU?ed back to SP\'07.',NULL,NULL,'',NULL,'Per PART\'s 12/10 update: NCAL, SCAL and CO impacted by second of new issues.\r\nShoba Selvarajan ran another query on 12/10.\r\n12/13/09: Sent f/up email to B.

However, in specific Second Sign workflows, orders might not be placed or released correctly. Additionally, depending on the scenario, a second signature might be incorrectly marked as required or not required.  NOTE: the Second Sign feature is not the same as Cosigning.\r\n\r\nFollowing are the categories of scenarios that could occur as a result of this defect.\r\n\r\nRULE CONFIGURATION\r\n\r\n1. A rule may be configured so that the Second Sign check box is displayed to clinicians to give them the option to require a second signature for an order. In this rule, you can specify that the Second Sign check box be selected by default while still allowing the ordering clinician to clear the check box. \r\n\r\nWhen a rule is configured as described above and an ordering clinician clears the Second Sign check box for an order, a second signature is incorrectly still required. In this scenario, the order is not released until the second signature is obtained, even though the ordering clinician intentionally cleared the check box so as not to require a second signature for the order. As a result, the release of the order might be delayed, and the ordering clinician might not realize that the delay is due to the second signature being required. \r\n\r\n2. A rule may be configured that determines when a second signature is required, based on an attribute of the order such as how many times the order occurs. If a clinician changes that value for the order, the change might cause the order to require a second signature based on the rule configuration without notifying the ordering clinician. \r\n\r\nORDER MODIFICATION \r\n\r\n1. A modified order that requires a second signature might be incorrectly released before a patient is transferred when using the Pre-Transfer Medication Reconciliation Navigator. \r\n\r\n2. A modification to an order that requires a second signature might not be applied to the order upon a patient\'s arrival when using a Pre-Transfer Medication Reconciliation Navigator. \r\n\r\n3. When an order is modified, a new order is created unless the property that was modified was one of those listed in the Allowed Medication Modifications field on the Inpatient Allowed Order Modifications screen in EMR System Definitions. A clinician might not receive notification that an order requires a second signature when the order is modified and the new order is created. When the ordering clinician modifies the order, the Summary Sentence for the new order does not indicate that the order requires a second signature, and the Second Sign check box is not selected by default. \r\n\r\nFollowed-By Linked Orders\r\n\r\nFollowed-by linked orders are orders that are grouped so that they occur in a specific sequence. When a clinician modifies an order that is part of a linked group, the modification impacts the other orders in the group. For example, modifying the scheduled time of one order in the linked group changes the scheduling time of the other orders in the linked group. If one order in a linked group is designated as needing a second signature, the system requires all the orders to have a second signature to ensure that the entire group is either active or inactive.\r\n \r\nThe following issues can occur when requiring a second signature for followed-by linked orders: \r\n\r\n1. When a second clinician signs an order that is part of a linked group, the linked relationship between the orders is not saved. As a result, the orders can be modified individually so that their time sequences are out of order. When the orders appear in navigators and reports in a different time sequence than was intended, it can result in the orders being acted upon at the wrong times. \r\n2. When a second signature is required for an order that is part of a linked group, the order might be incorrectly pended, instead of released.
