Previously, these interface specifications used the PV1_ADMIT_DT profile variable to populate PV1-44 (Admit Date/Time). This profile variable only allowed you to specify an item in the Patient (EPT) master file from which to obtain the value for PV1-44. Now, the Outgoing Orders, Outgoing Dietary Orders, Outgoing Pharmacy, and Outgoing Pharmacy AutoDispense Interfaces use the ADMIT_DATE profile variable to send a value in PV1-44.

This results in the Inbasket search not being able to find these messages. The reason the retract tag is being called is because of the co-sign flow. If a transcription requires a co-signer, the Inbasket message is sent to two providers - when one of them accepts the transcription, it is retracted from the other\'s In Basket. So, due to the fact that both the dictating and co-signing providers share the same EOW record, we will do the following:\r\nIf Dictating does not sign, but the Cosigner signs, the shared EOW will be marked as DONE in both inbaskets.\r\nIf Dictating signs and Cosigner signs, the shared EOW will be marked as DONE in both inbaskets.','AIP 898101\r\n  Change profile varible AFTER_ACCEPT_PP to:\r\nd sendDoc^ASTOTR1(898100,ID,DAT,user,\"DOC_AUTH\",hnoID,HNODAT) i checkres=\"\"&&($$geti^AIlib9(\"HNO\",hnoID,1035,0,99999)>0) d noFWD^ASTHIFL3(MID,\"\",\"\",1) f %1=1:1:$$geti^AIlib9(\"EOW\",MID,91,0,99999) s %2=$$geti^AIlib9(\"EOW\",MID,91,%1,99999) d:$p(%2,\";\",2)\'=user ChgStat^HTSTAT2(MID,%2,5)',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'RA331v2 - Installed in Prod on 5/26 - Lisa confirmed workflow with Dr. Bornstien',NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2006-08-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'2006-05-26 00:00:00','2006-05-26 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(474,1,47,NULL,40,13,332,NULL,'C','CL','N',NULL,NULL,NULL,'N','D','M',NULL,NULL,854040,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Toggle Flexible Event on Incoming Problem List interface','Lisa Pfeifer',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Aaron M','The change has been requested to support the following requirements:\r\n1) If an active problem list entry exists on a patient and a second problem list entry is sent in error the message.\r\n2) If a problem list entry is resolved and a new entry is sent over the interface, re-activate the first entry.\r\n3) If no problem list entry exists or one is deleted and a new entry is sent over the interface, add the entry as normal.','AIP 898201\r\n  PV BEFORE_FILE change to:\r\ns %AIP(\"FLEXIBLE_EVENT\")=$s($$geti^AIlib9(\"LPL\",$$FindLPL^LNOPROB8(%AIM(\"Pat\",\"ID\"),%data(\"PRB\",1,\"PRBID\")),160,1,99999)=1:0,1:1)',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'RA332 - Installed in Prod on 5/3 - RFC needed to be cancelled, but change was still made',NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2006-08-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'2006-05-09 00:00:00','2006-05-09 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(475,1,35,NULL,28,1,338,1425495,'C','CL','N',NULL,NULL,NULL,'N',NULL,'H',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Lab Results not showing under correct view in Hyperspace','Sandra',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Rohit','06/27/06 - Cleanup of all effected orders has been completed successfully.

However, this change incorrectly started sending the location information from the releasing encounter for Outpatient Lab and Rad orders as well.  Prior to the changes, the department and facility of the ordering encounter (versus releasing encounter) were sent for Outpatient Lab and Rad orders.  This new change is resu','Solution - Outpatient orders issues: \r\nEpic has provided a fix (custom item AII 898493) so that Outpatient Lab and Rad orders will send the department and facility of the ordering encounter if that encounter is Outpatient or HOV (Hospital Outpatient Visit).  This change has been made in WITSCA and needs to be tested - initial testing has passed.  Once testing has completed successfully, an emergency RFC will be created and implemented into Production.  The target date for Production deployment is Monday, 8/28/06. \r\n\r\nSolution - Discharge orders issues: \r\nIt was determined that the current logic for Lab and Rad orders placed as discharge orders from an Inpatient encounter won\'t work since the Ordering Provider (OBR-16) might not be associated to a department in the releasing facility, resulting in failed Rad order messages in MRMS.  So, Epic will provide an ad hoc fix to send the department from the releasing encounter, but the facility from the ordering encounter for these Lab and Rad discharge orders.

The 13 month load interface does include a department (CPM sub-department) in field PV1-3.01 and originating facility in field PV1-3.04.

For PAP/HPV results coming from KP NCAL\"s PRL system the decision was made to release a new Epic order to MyChart instead of the existing Epic order.

Usually the 20002 error occurs when there is bad order transmittal setup ie an order type is routed to the interfaces as a destination (LPP 4100) when it shouldn?t be. \r\n \r\nThe order triggering code looks to the order type (ORD-30) of an ORD record to determine which interface to send the order out of. For example orders with an order type of 5-Radiology get sent to AIP 410. The triggering code doesn?t know which interface it should have sent an order to, it creates an AIL record for all of the standard (400, 410, 430, 600) orders interface. Therefore, for every 1 ORD record that gets improperly routed to the interfaces by order transmittal, we end up with 4 AIL records getting built. \r\n \r\nCurrently, order transmittal is routing outpatient orders with an order type of 1-Procedure to the interfaces. As far as I can tell, there is no interface that is expecting to send an ?procedure? order as an ORM message.

This means that with I755352/ E753919 installed, the following is how a T11 is processed in 898103:\r\n\r\n1. PROCESS_EVENT_PP sets the \"old\" availability status to 2\r\n2.

The ZRG segment for her SD information includes her termination date.\r\n\r\nThe SRO facility is reporting this problem and would like it to be corrected. \r\n\r\nTried a manual fix but an update from CPM again inserted the second specialty.','','ZSP-14 has the effective dates of the speciality, and possibly is being ignored.\r\n\r\nHere are his observations for the example provider given in the Remedy PR:\r\n\r\n	- the first ZSP segment in the message contains the \"Resident\" speciality\r\n	- the ZRG segment immediately following it contains a \"Y\" in ZRG-4, indicating this is the primary location for the provider\r\n	- the ZSP segment immediately following the \"primary\" location does not contain speciality information\r\n	- the Epic code then posts last speciality information it has in the message, which in this case is \"Resident\"\r\n	- the Epic code is not looking at the end-date in this case.\r\n\r\nIt doesn\'t look like this is related to the March and May K-Packages installed on August.  It\'s more likely to be a result of the way the data lines up for these providers.\r\n\r\nWe don\'t know whether this intended behavior, or just an unusual loop-hole in the logic that hasn\'t been hit before. \r\n\r\n','','',NULL,'','','',NULL,'','10/31/09 New Item',NULL,NULL,37,37,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-10-30 09:59:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-11-30 00:00:00','2022-04-04 03:57:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(838,1,58,NULL,37,NULL,0,0,'C','AMB','N','N','N',NULL,'Y','D','M',NULL,'L',0,0,0,0,'Radiology Dependency Between SC and Results','Fred Law','','','','','Daniel Loewenstein','Enforce the filing dependency between Radiology Status Change and Results via background monitor configuration.  \r\n\r\nThis will allow us to manually start Radiology when coming back from degraded mode.','','','','',NULL,'','','',NULL,'','11/16 WITS Test Successfull',NULL,NULL,37,37,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-11-06 04:13:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-12-15 00:00:00','2010-06-17 03:21:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(839,1,61,'',37,0,0,0,'O','IP','N','Y','Y','','Y','P','M','','L',0,0,0,0,'PCP Error Work Queue','Ginger Yin','500','','','','N/A','Build on-line error queue for PCP Interface from PCLS application #898703\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\nView only security class needed to prevent re-submit.\r\n\r\nGinger Yin has not Bridges security class in production, so adding Bridges will not affect her current AC access.\r\n\r\n\r\n','','','View only security class needed to prevent re-submit.','','','',NULL,'',NULL,'','11/4 New View-Only Security Class Approved','','',37,37,NULL,0,NULL,'2009-11-06 04:15:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','2009-12-15 00:00:00','2009-11-06 04:21:00',NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,'','','','',''),(840,1,60,NULL,37,NULL,0,0,'O','RC','N','N','N',NULL,'Y','D','M',NULL,'L',0,0,0,0,'Perficient Error Management / Pilot','Lynn Nelson','','','','','IB - Frankie Lee','Move Lotus Notes reports into a Sox-Compliant error management platform.
