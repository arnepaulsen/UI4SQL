No need to remediate data.','The reason this occurred is because Kaiser is employing functionality called \"Contact Redirection.\"  Before the Cadence Outpatient check-in was performed into the Rad department at 2:22pm, another Cadence outpatient check-in was initiated for the same patient in the same department at 2:21pm.  HC did a conversion on the 2:21pm check-in and made it an HOV visit and sent an A04 over the ADT interface.  This is the standard functionality.  When the second Cadence check-in into the same department was done at 2:22pm, HC used Contact Redirection to associate this second check-in to the previous one.  Thus, no conversion was done to change this second encounter into an HOV encounter.  When the second encounter was cancelled at 2:25pm, a cancel message was sent over both the Cadence and ADT interfaces.  Since this second encounter was never converted to HOV, the ADT items were removed and the department was pulled from DEP 40 instead of being pulled from ADT items.
