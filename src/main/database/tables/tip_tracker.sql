We on the order set team review newly submitted requests weekly, triage and then forward to the regional domain for review/approval.\nWe would be doing this next Tuesday, but since I have this email open, I am triaging and have a couple of questions.\n\nBehrang, can you please confirm the order set that this order is on? I did a quick database search and find this order on the Thoracic Surgery Post Op 414249 order set. NPO is available in addition to the order for tube feeding on this particular order set so please let us know if there is another that needs change. \n\nAlso, requests for changes need to be reviewed by the local domain before being submitted; so can you confirm the domain that approved and the local physicain sponsor? Please enter that physicians name in the \"requestor\" field; you will remain the submitter.

To facilitate optimizing work flows for all while giving more \"specific\" instructions unique to Retinal Surgery.\n\n\nBackground information/context setting:    \n\nThere are no related Order Sets for Retina surgery. There are multiple medications and other items on General Ophthalmology order sets created for use of General Ophthalmologists that is not relevant to or used in Retina surgery.  The Retina Surgeon is often having to hand type , hand search medications or create special nursing instruction orders which are unique to our patients or procedures.   Such process leads to more errors on orders as well as with nursing instructions along with making the process of ordering more time consuming. \n\nPresence of an order set for this discipline reduces Physician errors, streamlines the Physicians work flow while giving nursing staff, reliable, accurate information.\n\n\n\nNote: The answer for 1-3 is no.  The order set merely streamlines the order process for Retina Surgeons, eliminating multiple items that they would not use and including items that they do. It will not affect the nursing work flows or procedures in place already.\nPhysician Sponsor\nGreer L.

To facilitate optimizing work flows for all while giving more \"specific\" instructions unique to Retinal Surgery.\n\n\nBackground information/context setting:    \n\nThere are no related Order Sets for Retina surgery. There are multiple medications and other items on General Ophthalmology order sets created for use of General Ophthalmologists that is not relevant to or used in Retina surgery.  The Retina Surgeon is often having to hand type , hand search medications or create special nursing instruction orders which are unique to our patients or procedures.   Such process leads to more errors on orders as well as with nursing instructions along with making the process of ordering more time consuming. \n\nPresence of an order set for this discipline reduces Physician errors, streamlines the Physicians work flow while giving nursing staff, reliable, accurate information.',NULL,'1211912269?H521379?Tina H Hamilton\n\nTIGR review; note to Maggie Mentakis:\n\nOur IP ClinCon team reviewed new order set SRs today. We reviewed the request for a NEW Retinal Post Op Order set (screen shot of orders below). Sherry Ellis noted that this is very similar to the current  PostOP HAS ASC orders OPH IP NCAL (414197) and wonders if it is possible to modify the current order set to reflect some of the finer points so as to avoid developing and maintaining a separate order set for Retinal. Please advise. Dr. Greer Gieger is the Retinal Surgeon sponsor of this order set.?1214926239?H521379?Tina H Hamilton\n\n6/25/08 email Amitabh K Bharadwaj/CA/KAIPERM\n1.

This was verified with a phone call to SCL colleagues. \nDr. Brugger to forward Dr. Albin Leongâ€™s email to Tina. \n\nThe thought was that the volume of saline was based on adult doses. \n<BR><BR>2009-03-09 - Tina H Hamilton - email from Emily Foo to Sherry Ellis forwarded to goverance:\nHi Sherry and Sean, \n\nI dont believe there is a standard dose recommended for the induction.  The hypertonic saline is delivered as an aerosol via a nebulizer.  Hypertonic saline comes in 3%, 7%, and 10%.  The 3% and 10% comes in 15 mL container which would probably work if set as the default dose volume.   I would assume there would be a local protocol at each facility for RT to follow for the induction process.  (Perhaps adding some verbiage \"per local protocol\" might help?) Received BEFORE pedi domain clarification. \n<BR><BR>2009-03-10 - Tina H Hamilton - email Albin Leong, re: Pedi dosing\nSeparate email forwarded to cced list.  Let me know if more info is needed.   The Hyper-Sal comes as 4ml vials of 3.5% and 7% (the 7% is the usual dose for CF patients on chronic mucus clearance using this therapy, who use 1 vial=4cc bid).  Our pharmacy carries a 3% that comes in 15ml vials.  For CF patients and the CF order set, the order should be for 7% hypertonic saline (Hyper-Sal) 4ml (this is in the outpatient pharmacy list).\n\nDan,\n\nThanks for keeping me in this loop!  I think this would be appropriate for our CF patients, but with modifications.  The following would be the modifications:\n\n1)  We would ordinarily use the unit dose (4ml) of 7% hypertonic saline for this purpose.  Also, the volume listed, 15 ml is not commonly used, even for adults, so Im wondering where that volume in the order came from.\n2)  I would keep the 3% hypertonic saline (we use this in our bronchiolitis patients), especially for infants or those CF patients who havent use hypertonic saline before.  (Again, the unit dose vial is 4cc)\n3)  The \"Sputum culture\" should be listed as \"Cystic Fibrosis Respiratory Culture\" (Code 87070Q)<BR><BR>2009-03-10 - Tina H Hamilton - TIGR review, confirmed list of impacted ordersets; Early goal directed therapy OS listed under both ED and ICU since it is used in both settings.

Emily and Sherry to coordinate adding both adult and pedi screen shots to the single change communication, to be sent to domains for approval, then review/comment.<BR><BR>2009-05-20 - Sherry Ellis - Spoke with Janet Margolis about this request.  I told her that we could request a new EAP record that could route to the RT inbasket for \"sputum induction\".  The hypertonic solution and lab would need to be ordered by the physician on the order set.  The RT would need to look on the MAR for the hypertonic solution, and on the PER to see what lab test was ordered.  Janet stated she was going to be in Fremont today and would discuss this with the requester \"Barbara Sheldon\" and get back with me later today.  I left a voice message and email for Tracy Lee (coder) to provide the appropriate CPT code for \"sputum induction\" so I may make a request for new EAP from CMT.<BR><BR>2009-09-15 - Tina H Hamilton - TIGR review, no record of response to last comment posted. Left phone message for Janet Margolis to call Sherry Ellis re: RT agreement with suggested EAP and workflow. \nPlan, this will require RT peer and domain agreement on workflow and changes.<BR><BR>2009-09-15 - Sherry Ellis - Spoke with Janet Margolis and Barbara Sheldon about this request.  Discussed the proposed workflow for this request.  Barbara Sheldon is requesting updated screen shots of proposed smart group to discuss with the Respiratory Therapy Leads meeting October 9th.  She understands that my recommendation is to embed a smart group within specialty/ selected order sets vs. her original request for a stand alone order set (for 2 orders).  After agreement from Barbara S. after her October 9th meeting, it will be necessary to vet this request among HBS, ICU, and ED domain groups.  Then I will need to request a new EAP record that says \"Request RT to perform Sputum Induction\" this will route to the \"respiratory section\" of the PER (after consultation with Stephanie Gavigan we are unable to route it to the nursing comm section) with a frequency of per comments so Nursing may release this order if they are unable to obtain a sputum specimen and it will route to the RT inbasket pool.  The orders for hypertonic saline cannot be pre selected because a clinical decision needs to be made if the patient has Pneumocystis (for 3% solution), the details of the hypertonic saline orders should be as needed one time for sputum induction.<BR><BR>2009-09-15 - Sherry Ellis - Sent new screen shots today.<BR><BR>2009-11-05 - Sherry Ellis - Sent email to Barbara Sheldon and Janet Margolis inquiring to the status of this request following their Oct 9th regional RT meeting.<BR><BR>2009-12-02 - Sherry Ellis - Recieved email from Janet Margolis and Barbara Sheldon on 11/24/09 with further enhancements to SR per Dr. Maurice Franco.  Replied to email today advising them that the number of sputum collections is done at the order level as well as the hour frequency that they would like (see attachement dated today).  If additional respiratory micro labs are desired, Janet (or site support) to update this SR with requested labs.  THH will then forward request to domain leads (HBS, ED , ICU) and direct questions to Janet and Dr. Franco.<BR><BR>2009-12-02 - Tina H Hamilton - Screen shots and list of labs sent to domain leads for a final approval of labs per each order set. Also, noted Remedy note requesting different hypersal for pedi CF patients so need to circle back to pharmacy to verify that the build as shown is OK for pedi CF.\nPlan, if Adult domains approve build and labs on all listed order sets, send for review and comment this month, for HCG 1/20/10.<BR><BR>2009-12-02 - Tina H Hamilton - email Christina Shih; I think I said I thought the EDs would rarely use this but it was okay to add.  Could it be collapsed?didng the labs are okay, we would use the AFB and fungal, for instance.  Cytologies rarely. \nJami DeSantiago: This looks like a good idea to me, I can support this change to the order sets.\nHerb Szeto: Yes, as long as the section is collapsed.<BR><BR>2009-12-02 - Tina H Hamilton - Lorna Yamaguchi: agree.

As you know, we have reports that have been written, but may not meet our needs.  \n\nIf we use clarity and our current processes, we will need code to create a column for the 3rd bucket (even though the information is already in the system).  As you know, this can be a long process, and this information is not something that can wait.  What I would like you to consider is utilization of the reporting workbench for building many of these reports.  It uses realtime data, can be exported to excel and has more flexibility.  \n\nIn opTime, we have tweaked the system as much as makes sense at this time.  \n\nWe on the project team now need to concentrate on our reporting capabilities so we can reach our access and quality goals.  The job of the facility has transitioned to assuring that the endusers are using the system appropriately, so that the information is accurately captured.\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts. You are the experts on the reporting workbench and I need your expertise.  It will likely be a valuable tool for the rest of inpatient also.\n\nThanks,\n\nMaggie Mentakis\nAssociate Inpatient Physician Leader\nNorthern California KP HealthConnect\nPhysician Implementation Lead, KPHC, SSC\nIT Chief, SSC\n(510) 368-4369\"\n...>?1178046730?Z702976?Mary C Healy\n\nCR from Epic, to request new code for this added 5/1/07.?1207215963?U749537?Kimberly M Starks\n\nSent email to Sandy regarding business requirements.?1207332929?U749537?Kimberly M Starks\n\nReassigning back to business queue.?',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(2173,0,'N',1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1549760,NULL,'RPT: Modify Columns | Request Anes & Anes Types',NULL,'SR',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'L','0','L',NULL,NULL,NULL,'','','',NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,'0','Clo','0','KPHC CN IP OPTIME BUSINESS',NULL,'Application Services','KPHC Inpatient OpTime','Application Configuration','','L','N','Y','C','0','NR','N','N','PERI','0','0','0','0','0','0','0',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2008-12-22 06:51:18','2007-03-19 15:27:40',' ','','','','',NULL,'',NULL,NULL,726,NULL,197,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','2008-11-14 03:26:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Request to modify OpTime Report \n\nColumn: \"NCAL Anesthesia Type\"  (495069)  \n\nFields:\nCaption column: Requested Anes\nItem: All Panels - Anesthesia Types [2006]\n\nOrigin: Melanie or Sandy?\n\n9/4/07.

If a fluid bolus is needed, it is administered from this existing bag of fluids.  However, in KPHC, when the order for an IV bolus is entered, it registers on the MAR (and then on the flowsheet) as a *new* IV Fluid.  The result is that there are multiples lines on the Doc Flowsheet for NS or LR (even though only one bag of fluid is hanging).\n\nSo, this request is to have LR and NS behave the same way as titratable medications, therefore, adjustments can be made to the rate without complicating the flowsheet.\n\nI will attach a screenshot to illustrate this issue.?1214434825?D899443?Alexander H Koppel\n\nChris to f/u with Brian and close if he denies this.?',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(2184,0,'N',1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1967002,NULL,'SSC-IP2:  Perinatal is requesting a system report or list that will contain both scheduled inductions and c-sections.',NULL,'SR',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'L','0','L',NULL,NULL,NULL,'','','',NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,'0','Clo','0','KPHC CN RIMS','RIMS','End User Applications','KPHC Inpatient MD/CRNA/Midwife Content','Enhancement','','L','N','Y','S','0','NR',' ','N','PERN','0','0','0','0','0','0','0',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2008-12-04 15:35:10','2008-12-05 12:19:26','2007-09-20 10:49:33',' ','','','','',NULL,'',NULL,NULL,1124,NULL,197,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','2008-11-14 03:34:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'SSC-IP2:  Perinatal is requesting a system report or list that will contain both scheduled inductions and c-sections.

Because the ST dept only has 6 day/week coverage, it is important for us to know if a dysphagia eval comes in for Speech because they need to get the eval done within 24 hours.  In the past (before Healthconnect) the ST evals came over the FAX machine just like the PT evals and we knew if an important eval came through.  Unfortunately, when the PTs open their in-box, we have no idea whether ST has orders or not.  So my question is, do you have the capacity to make the ST orders show up in a file in the PT in-box so the PTs know if and when an important ST eval shows up?  That way the PT dept (which has 7 day/week coverage) would have the capacity to at least screen out the ASAP orders for ST and possibly contact a speech pathologist over the weekend if needed.

These were meant to be Communication orders, not Best Practice Alerts, nor were they supposed to be \"Contraindication\" orders.  To give some history and background on this section of the order set, Cathy Norbutas and I came up with this as a way to prompt the MD to document aspirin status on chest pain patients, even if it was just in the orders.  What happens now is that the two first options- NOT GIVEN, ALREADY GIVEN PRIOR TO ED ARRIVAL and NOT GIVEN, SUSPECTED NON-CARDIAC CHEST PAIN-- trigger a contraindication flag which must then be acknowledged before moving on.  This ends up being a bit of an annoyance.\n\n     However, it is not the biggest issue with this section.  When opening this orderset, one is forced to choose one of the options.  This is true if youve already opened and used the order set.  I had a case where I wanted to order NTG drip on a patient whose Troponin came back positive after he had been here awhile (we still suffer here at SSC without bedside Troponins). The order set is the quickest place to find this, which I knew (and the order in the Preference List is worded differently, and I think incorrectly).  However, you cannot sign the order for the NTG drip without first either ordering something from the Anti Platelet section, forcing you to either a) order aspirin, which is already on board, or b) fire off a contraindication alert, which is not what I want either.\n\nIdeally these options within the Anti-Platelet section would be changed to what the original intent was, which is a way to simply document the aspirin status, or order aspirin if need be.  Im not sure if putting Communication orders within this section is possible or impossible w/in EPIC- I know that there are some limitations on what can be grouped together.',NULL,'1196189955ï££H521379ï££Tina H Hamilton\n\nTIGR review; options explored.

Note that more than one supplement or TF can exist at one time (there are some locations that want this flexibility).  If you wish to replace one TF formula or supplement with another, the first order must be discontinued.  In the case of supplements and TF, the ORDERS MODIFY option creates a new order with changes, however, doesnt discontinue the previous order as it does with diet orders.  With diets,  only one can exist at a time...so when a diet is modified the previous diet discontinues.  However, since more than one supplement or TF can be ordered at once, modifying the order creates a new order and also keeps the old order.  IT IS FINE TO USE ORDERS MODIFY TO MODIFY A SUPPLEMENT OR TF ORDER IF IT IS EASIER THAN CREATING A NEW ORDER, HOWEVER, THE ORIGINAL ORDER MUST THEN BE DISCONTINUED.  AGAIN, THIS APPLIES TO SUPPLEMENTS AND FORMULAS AND NOT TO DIET ORDERS.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n- I know we discussed the Duplicate Orders Notification Alert for KP Health Connect orders in the past and Nor CA was going to use the BAP instead.

Pure weight based orders carry a risk of overdosing in obese patients.  As a safey measure, a high dose limit is placed on the initial infusion order for non-cardiac heparin.  While there are different thoughts on what the limit should be, KPHC took the approach below to balance the risk of overdosing against the risk of underdosing.    \n\nBased on the patients weight, KPHC will limit the initial infusion dose of non-cardiac heparin to 1500 Units/hour for females and 2000 Units/hour for males.\n\nDecision support language (located at top of order set under \"criteria of use\") has been added to both heparin order sets (cardiac and non-cardiac) to guide optimal physician practices.

It is vitally important that adult cardiac patients receive lower dose \"cardiac\" heparin.  When cardiac patients receive higher dose \"non-cardiac\" heparin, along with other antithrombotic agents such as  aspirin, fibrinolytic therapy like TNKase, integrilin, etc, they have a significantly higher chance of bleeding complications and mortality.  Higher dose \"non-cardiac\" heparin is used to treat deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients who are NOT receiving aspirin or other antithrombotic agents. Recommended language also taken from Chiefs of Neurology that patients with acute stroke should generally not be given heparin, and in rare circumstances when this is beneficial, an intravenous bolus should not be given.\n\nDecision support language (located at top of order set under \"criteria of use\") has been added to both heparin order sets (cardiac and non-cardiac) to guide optimal physician practices.  This was taken from the KPNC ACS Guideline and regional \"paper\" order templates for IV heparin.  Other change includes removal of aPTT level at baseline (no longer needed).\n\nThe new PRL enhancement to inpatient health connect provides an additional safety feature for the weight-based dosing to not exceed the maximum recommended doses of IV heparin (eg. for cardiac patients, maximum bolus of 4000 units and 1000 units/hour infusion).

However, given its complex pharmacokinetic characteristics which some clinicians dont fully understand, amiodarone can often be prescribed suboptimally or in ways that do not give patients the desired benefit. Therefore, the Amiodarone HBS Order Set is now being revised to include decision support language describing amiodarones unique properties and how best ordering practices should reflect these characteristics. Non-standard dosing options for amiodarone have been removed. Rather, standard oral loading and tapering regimens have been included (these orders for tapering doses can be edited and tailored to individual patient needs, as appropriate). With these loading regimens, it is important to follow serial EKGs for QT prolongation and for nurses to contact a physician when a patients rhythm changes or converts to normal sinus rhythm; these orders have been added as well.\n\nPhysician Sponsor Name:\nPhilip C Lee, MD, Inpatient Cardiology Domain Lead\nMichael Lauer, MD, KPNC Electrophysiologist\n\nDomain/SUIT that has approved the content:\nCardiology and Electrophysiology',NULL,'',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(2200,0,'N',1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Maggie Mentakis','',3104022,NULL,'Add VTE prophylaxis section to thoracic postop order set (414249)',NULL,'OS',NULL,'0',NULL,NULL,'L','R','M','D','',NULL,'','','',NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,'NOWRK','Res','0','KPHC CN IP ORDERSETS',NULL,'End User Applications','KPHC Inpatient MD/CRNA/Midwife Content','Order Set - MD','','M','N','N',' ',NULL,'NR',' ','N','PERI','0','0','0','0','0','0','0',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2008-11-26 10:25:02','2008-11-26 17:52:02','2008-12-01 11:02:48','2008-11-12 15:36:55',' ',NULL,'','','',NULL,'','','',459,NULL,201,201,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2008-11-18 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2008-11-18 08:47:00','2008-11-18 10:24:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Add VTE prophylaxis section to thoracic postop order set (414249)',NULL,'',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(2201,0,'N',1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Dr. Chitra Reddy, GSAA Nephrology Chief','',3102590,NULL,'Add Blood pressure limit information to all Epogen orders in KPHC',NULL,'OS',NULL,'0',NULL,'0','L','R','H','0','Epogen Blood Pressure Limit',NULL,'','','',NULL,NULL,NULL,'5/5/09 THH:  Hello Dr. Rathore,\r\nI am reviewing emails and just want to touch base with you re: the note you sent Anne Foss-Durant on 5/1.\r\n\r\n\"Inpatient health connect\r\nThat is incorrect.

A Cardiology Summit was held which included physician, nursing, and pharmacy representatives from the 3 KPNC main cardiology facilities (WCR, SFO, SCH) which provide tertiary care for the most complex cardiology patients.  Input was received from this summit and reviewed for appropriateness and consensus.  This order set was built with the following considerations in mind:\n--requests were received for order sets related to pre- and post-pacemaker implantation, pre- and post-defibrillator implantation, pre- and post-electrophysiology study, and cardioversion\n--it was decided that all of these order sets could be consolidated into TWO order sets entitled: Pre-Device/Electrophysiology Procedures and Post-Device/Electrophysiology Procedures.  Flexibility and comprehensiveness of this consolidated order set allows for these order sets to be used for the various applicable clinical situations.\n--a combination of input from the Cardiology Summit and expert advice from the KPNC Electrophysiology Service resulted in agreed upon clinical content and orders that would be applicable throughout KPNC\n--new order set was compared with other similar and related cardiac order sets (e.g. pre-cath, post-cath, pre-PCI, post-PCI, interfacility cardiac transport order set) to ensure consistency of orders and overall format among similar order sets\n--language at top of order set guides which hospitals can use the order set. Order set can be used throughout KPNC at hospital where it is appropriate to do so.\n\n\nPhysician Sponsor Name:\nPhilip C.

This includes appropriate diet orders, lab workup, poct monitoring, and insulin administration orders, as well as a treatment protocol for pediatric patients with hypoglycemia.\n\nBackground info/context:  The majority of children admitted to the hospital with diabetes are Type 1 diabetics at the time of onset.  The majority of them are not in DKA, but need to be hospitalized to begin insulin treatment and the process of family & patient education.  Thus far, admitting these patients (which occurs relatively frequently on the pediatric ward) has been extremely laborious with Health Connect given the number of very specialized diet, lab, poct, and insulin orders that they require.  This order set was constructed in order to both (a) streamline the admission process, and (b) standardize the orders according to best practices.  The hypoglycemia protocol supports the order set and contributes to patient safety.\n\nPhysician sponsor name:  Brian Cassidy, MD and Stevan Cavalier, MD\n\nDomain approving:  Regional Pediatric content team (led by Dr. Stevan Cavalier).\n\nThanks,\nBrian Cassidy, MD',NULL,'1202342470?P209674?Christie F Vidal\n\nReceived  paper orderset from Sherry Ellis and begining to build orderset.?1203313688?H521379?Tina H Hamilton\n\n2/8/08 released into WCR limited pilot.

Awaiting response\nThere are no heparin orders on the t-PA orderset, in fact, there is decision support language built into the orderset stating that aspirin and heparin are not to be given after t-PA.  The stroke admission orderset does contains both ASA and SQ heparin.    We could merge the ordersets for tPA patients and delete the ASA and heparin to minimize the risk.  The only issue is that it doesnt support the workflow since tPA would be given in the ED and the rest of the stroke admission orders should probably be signed and held until the patient gets admitted.  This is the reason we kept them separate.\nThe most practical alternative would be to create a separate post-tPA stroke admission orderset without those drugs.  Providers would need to know to choose the applicable orderset but we can prompt them in the corresponding ordersets.\n\n thoughts, suggestions, objections??1204646033?H521379?Tina H Hamilton\n\nemail exchange and confirmation by Emily Foo, Herb Szeto and Trupti Mehta:\nDear Dr. Mehta and Dr. Szeto,\nThis is the KPHC pharmacy team recommendation. Please let us know what you approve or direct as our course of action:\n\nSo, the recommendation is to remove the Heparin orders from the ANTICOAG HBS 414195 order set and provide a decision support statement, similar to the statement used on the ACS Order set:  Cardiac Heparin and Integrilin can be ordered using the NON-CARDIAC HEPARIN Order Set.\n\nDo you mean that \"standard heparin can be ordered using the NON-CARDIAC HEPARIN Order Set\"?  if so, I agree.\n\nSince heparin does not appear on the THROMBOLYTICS FOR CVA order set, we dont need to remove it, but there is an antiplatelet therapy section; the question for Dr. Mehta is is this the section that she recommends be removed?

Questions can we investigate what the new health connect orders are-Vicki can you share with us\nShould we pull the orders out-But what if Haldol is the only drug that works\n\n2/10/09\nPurpose/intent of new order set or change:\nRemoval of Haldol from the Altered Level of Consciousness order set\nAddition of cardiac warning and monitoring orders being added to the Restraint IP and ED orderset\nTo promote the safer use of haldol and improve the management of delerium and agitation in our hospitals.\n\nBackground information/context setting, rationale for change:\nLast year the FDA issued a warning on the use of Haldol.  (For details see: http://www.fda.gov/CDER/DRUG/InfoSheets/HCP/haloperidol.htm)  The attached orderset is the product of a workgroup convened by Regional P&T to address this issue as well as the more general issue of delerium and agitation in the hospital and emergency department.\nhttp://www.fda.gov/CDER/DRUG/InfoSheets/HCP/haloperidol.htm',NULL,'1198083855?M185768?Audrey E Barraza\n\nReassigning?1198870698?H521379?Tina H Hamilton\n\nPer Minh Nguyen 12/21/07: Here is the link to the FDA site: http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/InfoSheets/HCP/haloperidol.htm\nAlthough haldol is not approved for IV use, the FDA does recognize that the IV route is frequently use.

At that point the concern regarding QT Prolongation is moot. \nOur palliative care NP Erin Crawford is reviewing this issue with the Regional Palliative Care team and based on their recommendations we can proceed. \nMy personal view point is as above.\nI will keep you up dated as I find out more.  \nPlan: await response from regional Palliative Care team, act accordingly.?1199924337?H521379?Tina H Hamilton\n\nRequest for review sent to Chair of Palliative Care chiefs for recommendation by Trupti Mehta, MD>?1201733020?H521379?Tina H Hamilton\n\n1/13/08: Shelley Garone, MD, Med Director Palliative Care NVLY provided response; ECG haldol monitoring at end of life not recommeded.

In fact, Im told that the sedation score in the PCA orders are different than the standard level of consciousness used by the nurses on the ward, which has led to some confusion.   I have a question regarding the Call ifs for heart rate and BP.  Arent there already call ifs for these vitals in the patients floor orders?  Why should we duplicate them?

In any event, I would like to create a post-TPA ischemic stroke orderset if a change request isnt already in the system.  It would be the same as the ischemic stroke orderset except:\nThe vital sign section should correspond to what is in the tPA orderset\nThe SQ heparin and aspirin would be defaulted to start 24-48 hours after tPA administration (i.e. QAM, skip next AM dose).  \nLovenox needs to be removed from the DVT prophalaxis section.\nCoumadin needs to be removed.\n\nThere also needs to be language to hold these two medications and notify MD  for any evidence of bleeding.  Lastly, there needs to be decision support language in the tPA orderset to use the post-tPA ischemic stroke orderset for admission.\n\n\nIve already discussed this with the HBS domain group.  Im waiting to hear back on 1 issue from Dr. Klingman of neurology.\n\nPurpose/intent of new order set or change:\nA separate post-tPA  stroke orderset has been created to minimize the risk of hemorrhagic complications.\n\nBackground information/context setting, rationale for change:\nThe use of anti-platelet agents and anticoagulation is different in stroke patients who have received t-PA compared to those who have not.  Although there is decision support in the current orderset highlighting such differences, there remained a potential to inadvertantly start these medications earlier than intended.  This new orderset is designed spefically to address those differences.\n\nNew Purpose and background added 5/8/09\n\nPurpose/intent of new order set or change:\nThis orderset is designed for the management of stroke patients who have received tPA and to minimize risk of bleeding in this population.\nBackground information/context setting, rationale for change:\nThe HBS ischemic stroke orderset is currently used for all ischemic stroke patients.

Is it your intention that providers would always go to this new order set for post-tPA orders?  Currently, there is a Post-tPA section (mainly anti-platelets) on the Thrombolytics for Stroke order set.  Should this section be deleted once we have the new order set??1207752947?H521379?Tina H Hamilton\n\nemail from Dr. Szeto: \nYes, the antiplatelet section should be deleted in the tPA orderset.  In the vast majority of cases, tPA will be given while the patient is in the ED.  The antiplatelet drugs wont be started until the patient get up to the ICU so those orders must be signed and held.  If they are in the tPA orderset, the provider must continue them at admission.  Moreover, they would need to remember not to reorder them on the standard stroke admission orderset.  This is why we decided to create a separate post-tPA stroke orderset.

These were meant to be Communication orders, not Best Practice Alerts, nor were they supposed to be \"Contraindication\" orders.  To give some history and background on this section of the order set, Cathy Norbutas and I came up with this as a way to prompt the MD to document aspirin status on chest pain patients, even if it was just in the orders.  What happens now is that the two first options- NOT GIVEN, ALREADY GIVEN PRIOR TO ED ARRIVAL and NOT GIVEN, SUSPECTED NON-CARDIAC CHEST PAIN-- trigger a contraindication flag which must then be acknowledged before moving on.  This ends up being a bit of an annoyance.\n\n     However, it is not the biggest issue with this section.  When opening this orderset, one is forced to choose one of the options.  This is true if youve already opened and used the order set.  I had a case where I wanted to order NTG drip on a patient whose Troponin came back positive after he had been here awhile (we still suffer here at SSC without bedside Troponins). The order set is the quickest place to find this, which I knew (and the order in the Preference List is worded differently, and I think incorrectly).  However, you cannot sign the order for the NTG drip without first either ordering something from the Anti Platelet section, forcing you to either a) order aspirin, which is already on board, or b) fire off a contraindication alert, which is not what I want either.\n\nIdeally these options within the Anti-Platelet section would be changed to what the original intent was, which is a way to simply document the aspirin status, or order aspirin if need be.  Im not sure if putting Communication orders within this section is possible or impossible w/in EPIC- I know that there are some limitations on what can be grouped together.',NULL,'1196189955ï££H521379ï££Tina H Hamilton\n\nTIGR review; options explored.

I see that Kathy Cagney and Dr. Lorna Yamaguchi are copied on this email chain.  \n\nI do have one comment on the \"Dosing Weight\".  I would recommend changing the term to \"Order-Specific Weight\".\n\nIn KPHC, the term \"Dosing Weight\" refers to the weight entered in the Dosing Weight flowsheet (see below).  The system will use that weight to calculate ANY weight-base order.\nUsing the \"Order-Specific Weight\" will limit the use of that weight to that order only.  The physician can enter the weight to be used for that order only in the order composer.\nThere are ways KPHC can limit the initial infusion to a weight.  The use of the \"Order-Specific Weight\" above is the<BR><BR>2008-12-02 - Tina H Hamilton - email from Greg Marelich:\nThanks, Minh. I think that we could remove the references to \"dosing weight\" when the orderset is built, as you suggest, and use the order-specific weight instead.

Waiting for final decisions.<BR><BR>2009-09-30 - Gail L Gordon Gaskins - Email from Kathy Cagney:\nHi Barbara, all,\n\nWe discussed the issue whether the protocols associated with the Lepirudin and Argatroban order sets should be pharmacy driven or nursing driven at the Regional Critical Care Chiefs and Managers meeting on September 10th.  There was strong consensus from the group that we would prefer that pharmacy do the dose adjustment calculation, and relay the new dose to nursing to make the change.  \n\nThe rationale for this decision:\n\nThe relative rarity of use of the drugs will mean unfamiliarity with the protocols.  \nThere are times the drugs are used outside of the critical care areas.  \nThe concern is the unfamiliarity with the protocol and the many patient care activities and potential distractions that the staff nurse at the bedside has to deal with.\n\nTo summarize this email stream and capture the timeline of events:\n\nOriginally the protocols called for nursing to calculate any dose adjustments.\nThe order sets and protocols were sent out for review by various stakeholders.\nSome pharmacists felt the protocol should be pharmacy driven rather than nursing driven.\nThe Critical Care Domain agreed with this proposal at their September 2nd meeting.\nThe proposal was taken to the IPDs peer group meeting after the CC domain meeting, and they proposed having nursing drive the protocol, but double check it with pharmacy.\nBoth proposals were discussed at the Regional Chiefs, and there was consensus that the Nurse Managers and MDs would prefer the protocol be pharmacy driven.\n\nThe question now is what is the next step?  Who is the correct person or group to make a final operational decision on this issue.  Once this has been resolved the order sets and protocols are ready to be released.\n\nThanks,\nKathy<BR><BR>2009-10-02 - Jung M Lee - See comments from Argatroban.

Per Minh:\nWe had started to build the Regional order sets based on the documents sent to us a while ago.  We will wait for the final domain-approved documents before proceeding with the build.  I see that Kathy Cagney and Dr. Lorna Yamaguchi are copied on this email chain.  \n\nI do have one comment on the \"Dosing Weight\".  I would recommend changing the term to \"Order-Specific Weight\".\n\nIn KPHC, the term \"Dosing Weight\" refers to the weight entered in the Dosing Weight flowsheet (see below).  The system will use that weight to calculate ANY weight-base order.\nUsing the \"Order-Specific Weight\" will limit the use of that weight to that order only.  The physician can enter the weight to be used for that order only in the order composer.\nThere are ways KPHC can limit the initial infusion to a weight.  The use of the \"Order-Specific Weight\" above is the most flexible one.<BR><BR>2008-12-02 - Tina H Hamilton - email from Greg Marelich:\nThanks, Minh. I think that we could remove the references to \"dosing weight\" when the orderset is built, as you suggest, and use the order-specific weight instead. That might work better with the lepirudin dosing anyway. I hope to discuss these this week.\nGM<BR><BR>2008-12-15 - Jeremy D Vang - finished build first draft of the non-med in PROD lead.

Still in domain discussion.<BR><BR>2009-09-30 - Gail L Gordon Gaskins - Email from Kathy Cagney:\nHi Barbara, all,\n\nWe discussed the issue whether the protocols associated with the Lepirudin and Argatroban order sets should be pharmacy driven or nursing driven at the Regional Critical Care Chiefs and Managers meeting on September 10th.  There was strong consensus from the group that we would prefer that pharmacy do the dose adjustment calculation, and relay the new dose to nursing to make the change.  \n\nThe rationale for this decision:\n\nThe relative rarity of use of the drugs will mean unfamiliarity with the protocols.  \nThere are times the drugs are used outside of the critical care areas.  \nThe concern is the unfamiliarity with the protocol and the many patient care activities and potential distractions that the staff nurse at the bedside has to deal with.\n\nTo summarize this email stream and capture the timeline of events:\n\nOriginally the protocols called for nursing to calculate any dose adjustments.\nThe order sets and protocols were sent out for review by various stakeholders.\nSome pharmacists felt the protocol should be pharmacy driven rather than nursing driven.\nThe Critical Care Domain agreed with this proposal at their September 2nd meeting.\nThe proposal was taken to the IPDs peer group meeting after the CC domain meeting, and they proposed having nursing drive the protocol, but double check it with pharmacy.\nBoth proposals were discussed at the Regional Chiefs, and there was consensus that the Nurse Managers and MDs would prefer the protocol be pharmacy driven.\n\nThe question now is what is the next step?  Who is the correct person or group to make a final operational decision on this issue.  Once this has been resolved the order sets and protocols are ready to be released.\n\nThanks,\nKathy<BR><BR>2009-10-02 - Jung M Lee - IPD group discussed issues this week.  Leaning towards building as argatroban per pharmacy, as pharmacy-driven protocol.  Based on this decision IPD group still needs to discuss further on how to implement it as per pharmacy protocol.<BR><BR>2009-10-06 - Jung M Lee - Email from Doug OBrien, KPNC regional director for inpatient pharmacy services:\nWe discussed the argatroban/lepirudin order sets at the IPD Meeting on Thursday (10/1).\n\nThe IPDs reached consensus and would prefer that these order sets be changed and structured as \"per pharmacy protocol\" order sets.  \n\nThis will require several additional actions:\n\n1.  A \"per pharmacy protocol\" for argatroban/lepirudin dosing will need to be created.  Several volunteers have already begun work on the protocol.  This will entail double checking with the lab on the current control value (or mean value) for the aPTT to ensure the current dosing nomograms are still accurate.\n\n2.  The KPHC order sets will need to be modified, i.e. the starting dose should be left in the protocol, but the subsequent dose adjustments will be \"per pharmacy protocol.\"  A pharmacist will calculate each dose adjustment and enter it into KPHC.  The nurses will subsequently double check the dosing using the established HAMP Process.\n\n3.  The pharmacist protocol will need to be approved by each local P&T Committee.\n\n4.  The staff pharmacists will need to be trained on the new protocol.\n\n5.  In the interim, the staff pharmacists in San Francisco will begin monitoring any current patients on argatroban/lepirudin focusing on optimizing the operational details, e.g. flow sheets, handoff between pharmacists, utility of the current dosing nomograms, etc.\n\nAll of these actions will take some time to complete, so I dont have an exact kick-off date.\nThe \"per pharmacy protocol\" should be complete in approximately 2 weeks.<BR><BR>2009-10-23 - Jung M Lee - Protocol in progress by the IPD group.  Expect P&T approval around dec/jan for pharmacy protocol.<BR><BR>2009-11-02 - Jung M Lee - Protocol still being created by the IPD group.  Plan for P&T around dec/jan.

Questions related ICU shared with Maggie Mentakis, who reviewed screen shots. Per Maggie\nDay of surgery order set looks fine except there is a hard stop by diet that should not be there.  ?build error?\n\nThe first and second order sets in the email are both neurosurg day of surgery\n\nRe ICU orders:  The K+ protocol is regional.  They should not write their own in my mind.\n\n	I think changing verbiage to \"ambulate immediately upon arrival to ICU\" is a good idea.  The only question is if they wanted the ambulation to start in the PACU if the pt gets held there waiting for a bed...\nIn the seizure precaution order, need to copy what is in the gen ICU admission order set to the comments section in this order set\nthey may want to add the language that is in the GIAO (general icu admission orderset) about oral fluid restriction being part of the diet order\nthe language in the \"insert feeding tube\" order that states \"and get KUB for tube placement\"  needs to be removed.  The docs will think they dont have to order the KUB, and they do.  The order is just down below in the same section.  The main problem is they want this order on all patients, and not all patients will require a feeding tube... can the nurses use this as an order and place the order to radiology themselves??  I think this is the intent of the order.\nI agree we need to break the ulcer prophylaxis into categories and make single select.

There is no need for a NG tube (I was unable to change this screen shot to show the correct ordering details).  4. For the Propylthiouracil and the Methimazole the maintenance dose should say â€œStart 6 hours after loadingâ€  5. Add decision support at the top of the order set to state â€œUse in Consultation with Perinatologistâ€  6.  All Labs should be collect now stat, except for uruine 7.

Plan, return to 12/16/09 HCG. Note sent to Marc Schiff and Lorna Yamaguchi including HCG and build questions around monitoring/tele.To meet the 12/16/09 HCG schedule, all comment and changes need to be incorporated into the order set and finalized by 12/4/09.\n\n<Inderal IV: provide titration instructions with steps, incremental dosage adjustments and time intervals>\n\nAdditionally, Jaya Mokkapati reviewed the change communication and has asked if Atropine should be added to the telemetry orders (since it appears as part of the Telemetry Order Set)\n\nQuestions for Dr Schiff and Dr Yamaguchi\nSorry that this order set was not circulated to the Critical Care domain as part of the public scrutiny. \nGiven that this will be used primarily in ICU, do you want this to go out for ICU review and comment? \nPlease confirm that the correct impacted users and departments are noted on the change comm. Currently states \"Perinatologists and Registered Nurses, IP Pharmacy\".  (Moving forward, we will be asking order set sponsors to complete a checklist to indicate the settings in which the orderset will be used so that we are sure to obtain feedback from the right audience.)\n\nIn the nursing section, there is a order as follows: these instructions are not complete. What is the preferred text for the comments? \"Cardiac Monitoring per Unit Standard of Care\"?\nAlso, is this monitoring order redundant to the telemetry orders?\n\n\n\nWorkflow; Lorna, if this is used in ICU, is it necessary to order cardiac monitoring or is that part of the ICU standard of care??\nWould the tele order be placed if the patient is being treated in another area outside of ICU? Why not direct users to use the telemetry order set \nto order tele? \n<BR><BR>2009-12-04 - Gail L Gordon Gaskins - Reply from Dr. Schiff to HCG questions:\nHere are the answers to the questions raised at the last HCG meeting ..............\n\n--- Under nursing orders remove the initiate cardiac monitoring order completely, it is covered by the Telemetry orders in the Telemetry Section.\n\n--- For the questions on the propranolol IV order on page 2 please make the following changes\n\n1 mg, intravenous, every 4 hours, may increase by 1 mg each dose until heart rate less than 120 beats per minute unless directed otherwise by physician, maintain that dosage every 4 hours, decrease dose by half if heart rate less than 60 beats per minute. Maximum dose should not exceed 10 mg.\n\nThese are the only 2 questions I remember from the discussion at the meeting last month. If there are any other issues, please let me know as soon as possible and I will get answers for you. I have included screenshots of the areas in question.\n\nThank you,\nDr. Schiff\n\n<BR><BR>2009-12-04 - Gail L Gordon Gaskins - Email to Dr. Schiff:\nThanks Dr. Schiff,\nWe will make these changes.  Other questions that came up after HCG:\n1. Would the tele order be placed if the patient is being treated outside of ICU?  Why not direct the users to use the telemetry order set to order tele?\n2. Should Atropine be added to the Telemetry orders on this orderset (since it appears as part of the Telemetry os)?\n3. Given this order set is used primarily in ICU, does this need to go for public scrutiny (review and comment) to the Critical Care domain prior to bringing it back to HCG?  They were not included on the first round.\n\nHis changes in the previous note sent to Jung and Jennifer for updating.<BR><BR>2009-12-04 - Gail L Gordon Gaskins - Dr. Schiffs changes post HCG added as attachment.<BR><BR>2009-12-07 - Gail L Gordon Gaskins - Per Dr. Schiff:\nWe thought that the tele order would need to be placed for the cardiac monitoring even when outside the ICU.

That group is also considering the priority that should be assigned to addressing orders to those pharmacys within KPHC.\nIn the meantime, it would seem reasonable to me that orders are input in KPHC with an order class of \"Outside Fill\" then faxing the resulting prescription to the pharmacy.  Entering medications in this manner will allow clinical checking in KPHC and the pharmacy computer system (PIMS) will receive a \"shadow\"/nonfillable copy of the order for clinical checking.  \nThe limitations are represented by the need to fax the orders vs transmission within KPHC.\n\nRegards,\n \nTerry Moler, Pharm.D.\nPharmacist Consultant\nNCAL KP HealthConnect Ambulatory Pharmacy Services\nCell (916) 214-2850<BR><BR>2009-04-07 - Christie F Vidal - Sent E-mail to Terry moler to determine our next step in build for this orderset.<BR><BR>2009-04-16 - Christie F Vidal - send below e-mail to Terry Moler:\n\nTerry,\n\nI would like to discuss with you our options for building this orderset.

Now that he has moved to a new position, He stated that you may be the correct person to work with on this SR.\nChris Vidal	Would this be correct?\nIris Young	that\nIris Young	thats correct. \nIris Young	May I ask which SR it is?  \nChris Vidal	great can I give you the SR # \nChris Vidal	CHG000002675427\nChris Vidal	Please take a look and contact me with any questions.\nIris Young	Sure.. I will do that.  Are you forwarding me the entire SR?  \nChris Vidal	I can if you would like\nIris Young	Either way.. just wasnt sure if I should expecting the SR.

I spoke with Terry Moler.  Now he is still thinking that he will be owning the process of getting the AMB Smartset done for Cellulitus, in conjunction with the ED SUIT. \n\nNow, anything that is an Order Set, is outside of our scope.   And I do not have any contact, besides seeing Tina Hamilton on the Ticket who does the IP Ordersets, for this project. \n\nI spoke with Nancy Cadet who has been working on any IP Order Sets that would go to the Home Infusion Pharmacies.  She has not heard of this being built...  \n\nI am working solely on the transfer of HIP workflows into KPHC.  This does not include clinical content. \n\nSo, Terry says he is still working on this and is waiting for feedback from someone in Pharmacy...   \n\nHope this helps<BR><BR>2009-06-25 - Christie F Vidal - Britt and Bill Yee to meet to determine the correct process for these types of meds being added to the PROD. 6/24/09<BR><BR>2009-07-13 - Christie F Vidal - e-mailed Britt to ask what the status of her meeting with Bill Yee was.<BR><BR>2009-07-14 - Minh X Nguyen - started discharge med section building.

He will not be able to provide the feedback to meet the deadlines for 9/16/09 HCG because of workflow questions around this order set that he will discuss with Brian Hoberman. (This order set assumes ED practice of treat and release to Home Health infusion follow up. This is the practice is only at NVLY and possibly SRO.)

All agree that adding the order to the orderset and the nurses will review and print from the PER is the immediate pathway. Longer term desire would be to add to MAR toolbar, which would make the Pedi Emergency medications dosing calculator available in all settings where pedi patients may present for care (ED, PeriOp, sometimes on Adult floors, etc.) This will require review and approval across domains and can be added later. Do not delay work on adding the order to the Pedi ordersets now.<BR><BR>2009-02-17 - Tina H Hamilton - TIGR review, needs EAP record for nursing communication order. EAP record has been ordered. Pending URL and Pedi domain nursing documentation of expected workflow.

Using MAR toolbar is not the immediate scope.<BR><BR>2009-03-05 - Yoko Olsgaard - Following a long string of emails discussion rounding options, Craig released a test URL for the calculator. \nFinal decision was to calculate to 1 decimal place except where the rounding would cause some doses to be = zero - in which case the rounding will be carried out to 2 places.  Where an incorrect weight is entered (max is 100 kg) the calculator will set all calculated fields to zero until a correct weight is entered.  The calculator can be viewed and tested at this URL: \nhttp://cl-qa-new.crdc.kp.org/pkc/ncal/clib/tools/peds_emergency_meds_calculator/pediatric_emergency_meds_calculator.htm\n\nThis will be reviewed at the March 9 Pediatric Domain meeting.<BR><BR>2009-03-05 - Yoko Olsgaard - Ernest U has offered additional clarification regarding the Pediatric Emergency Meds Calculator.  The restriction on disallowing an inputted weight greater than 100 kg has been removed.  It is not the weight that is restricted but rather the maximum dose that is restricted.  Coding has been added to prevent the medications from exceeding their maximum dose limits regardless of what weight is inputted. \n\nThe calculator can be accessed at this URL:\n\nhttp://cl-qa-new.crdc.kp.org/pkc/ncal/clib/tools/peds_emergency_meds_calculator/pediatric_emergency_meds_calculator.htm<BR><BR>2009-03-09 - Tina H Hamilton - Nancy Aye requesting business testing and sign off, what is the process/\nemail sent to Nancy Aye re: governance steps.

Also, since SAC/ROS has done a lot of work around the subject, and is the origin for many of the comments, someone from there should sit in too.

Emily needs to review the albuterol dosing recommendations, in particular make sure the suggested initial continuous albuterol dose is 0.5 mg/kg/hr with a range of 5-20 mg/hr.   \n\nMy feeling is that we can add language that suggests the CBNT/IBNT protocols linked to the orderset are decision support, and can be used as is or locally adopted or not.  Interfacility cooperation (and KPHC itself) should allow us to share such protocols, and they can go through local approval processes PRN.  \n\nI dont want us to feel obligated to make sure every  location has exactly the same policies and protocols in place (which in a way are a kind of decision support) before linking to them.  For instance, like the CBNT/IBNT protocols and asthma scoring systems, we refer to diabetic guidelines and precautions, pain assessment, anesthesia recovery scores, neuro status checks, coma scoring, etc etc in our order sets, though the exact methodology/systems used vary from place to place.  \n\nIn fact, linking to well-considered P/Ps give  local facilities ideas about what regional, multidisciplinary groups agree on as best practices, and can help them improve their own local P/Ps.  MDs ordering these protocols locally (first two orders in the CBNT and IBNT sections) will learn to do so only where such protocols exist.  \n\nI would like to make sure we have RN as well as pharmacy representation on our PICU and PHBS content calls to get this settled.  The PICU content call is 930-11AM 8/5.  1 866 258 0960  *1089402*  Webcast via QWEST:  www.kpconferencing.qwest.com.  \n\nStevan\n\nCopied Kathryn R Blake and Ann OBrien; mtg info for Kathryn and Emily to join\nPlan; interim removal of protocols then revise per domain agreements<BR><BR>2008-07-31 - Tina H Hamilton - Pending Screen revision from Emily Foo.\nNote the following request from Albin Leong to consider for revision:\nJust a suggestion to consider albuterol MDI via spacer/holding chamber for intermittent therapy in the order set.  There is a fair amount of literature about comparative efficacy of albuterol delivered by MDI-spacer/holding chamber vs. nebulization.  Many leading pediatric hospitals use this mode primarily in their EDs and hospitals.  It is also an option for acute asthma in the EPR-3 guidelines.<BR><BR>2008-08-04 - Tina H Hamilton - Interim screens circulated by Emily Foo and approved by Stevan Cavalier and Kathryn Blake. Phone message and \"cc\" email to Dr. Schiff and Dr. ONeil to determine release date based upon local MEC approval. Meeting to further discuss content scheduled 8/5/08.<BR><BR>2008-08-05 - Tina H Hamilton - email per Albin Leong in response to screen shot:\nThis continuous dose looks good, with the current appropirate EPR-3 guideline albuterol dosing/weight & maximum dose.  For the intermittent, if that is also being discussed, the group, especiallly the intensivists, should discuss what they think their default should be.  Might I then suggest a drop down menu to include different frequencies such as  q20min, q 1h, 2h, 4h, q6h, *** and/or others, such as qid, q8h, etc.  The other consideration that might be discussed would be levalbuterol and albuterol MDI/spacer dosing.\n\nAlbin\n<BR><BR>2008-08-05 - Tina H Hamilton - email from Dan Brugger in response to screen shots:\nLooks good to me Emily.\n\nDan\n\nDan Brugger MD,MPH\nPediatric Hospitalist\nSouth Sacramento Kaiser Medical Center\nAssistant Inpatient Chief of IT SSC\nAssociate Lead NCAL Region Physician Training Inpatient KPHC\n<BR><BR>2008-08-07 - Tina H Hamilton - Per Marc Schiff and SAC team, OK to release changes today and follow up with MEC next week.

Are you keeping copies now? If so, what sort of patient identifier is on the original? (I stated in the communication document that a copy would be kept, but if this is not the current workflow, please let me know. Not sure in that case that we need a patient identifier...)\n\n2> How will we know when the State changes the forms? We can store what you provide, will the Pedi domain be responsible for letting KPHC know when forms are revised? If so, storing our own version makes sense. Otherwise, the State CEIP site has directions and the documents in pdf format. (I can see that having the documents merged into a single document and URL is easier than downloading and printing the individual forms found at the state site.)\n\n3> You mention below that this link would be in the order sets \"when they are all approved\". Are the ordersets currently under revision/creation so the timeline for the addition of the link is with their next version release? Or, is the addition of the link independent of other revision activities?\nMeningitis order set; partially built, not ready for governance\nSeptic shock; under revision, not yet sent for governance\nSeizure/Lumber Puncture: no draft build noted, are these under revision?\n\nThank you,\n\nTina Herrmann Hamilton, RN, BSN, PHN<BR><BR>2009-04-16 - Sean E Ryan - sent out email to Dr. Cavalier and Tina: \n\nIm just starting to look at the SR SR# CHG000002875281 - Pediatric California Encephilitis Project documentation; add a hyperlink with documentation.

This was verified with a phone call to SCL colleagues. \nDr. Brugger to forward Dr. Albin Leongâ€™s email to Tina. \n\nThe thought was that the volume of saline was based on adult doses. \n<BR><BR>2009-03-09 - Tina H Hamilton - email from Emily Foo to Sherry Ellis forwarded to goverance:\nHi Sherry and Sean, \n\nI dont believe there is a standard dose recommended for the induction.  The hypertonic saline is delivered as an aerosol via a nebulizer.  Hypertonic saline comes in 3%, 7%, and 10%.  The 3% and 10% comes in 15 mL container which would probably work if set as the default dose volume.   I would assume there would be a local protocol at each facility for RT to follow for the induction process.  (Perhaps adding some verbiage \"per local protocol\" might help?) Received BEFORE pedi domain clarification. \n<BR><BR>2009-03-10 - Tina H Hamilton - email Albin Leong, re: Pedi dosing\nSeparate email forwarded to cced list.  Let me know if more info is needed.   The Hyper-Sal comes as 4ml vials of 3.5% and 7% (the 7% is the usual dose for CF patients on chronic mucus clearance using this therapy, who use 1 vial=4cc bid).  Our pharmacy carries a 3% that comes in 15ml vials.  For CF patients and the CF order set, the order should be for 7% hypertonic saline (Hyper-Sal) 4ml (this is in the outpatient pharmacy list).\n\nDan,\n\nThanks for keeping me in this loop!  I think this would be appropriate for our CF patients, but with modifications.  The following would be the modifications:\n\n1)  We would ordinarily use the unit dose (4ml) of 7% hypertonic saline for this purpose.  Also, the volume listed, 15 ml is not commonly used, even for adults, so Im wondering where that volume in the order came from.\n2)  I would keep the 3% hypertonic saline (we use this in our bronchiolitis patients), especially for infants or those CF patients who havent use hypertonic saline before.  (Again, the unit dose vial is 4cc)\n3)  The \"Sputum culture\" should be listed as \"Cystic Fibrosis Respiratory Culture\" (Code 87070Q)<BR><BR>2009-03-10 - Tina H Hamilton - TIGR review, confirmed list of impacted ordersets; Early goal directed therapy OS listed under both ED and ICU since it is used in both settings.

Emily and Sherry to coordinate adding both adult and pedi screen shots to the single change communication, to be sent to domains for approval, then review/comment.<BR><BR>2009-05-20 - Sherry Ellis - Spoke with Janet Margolis about this request.  I told her that we could request a new EAP record that could route to the RT inbasket for \"sputum induction\".  The hypertonic solution and lab would need to be ordered by the physician on the order set.  The RT would need to look on the MAR for the hypertonic solution, and on the PER to see what lab test was ordered.  Janet stated she was going to be in Fremont today and would discuss this with the requester \"Barbara Sheldon\" and get back with me later today.  I left a voice message and email for Tracy Lee (coder) to provide the appropriate CPT code for \"sputum induction\" so I may make a request for new EAP from CMT.<BR><BR>2009-09-15 - Tina H Hamilton - TIGR review, no record of response to last comment posted. Left phone message for Janet Margolis to call Sherry Ellis re: RT agreement with suggested EAP and workflow. \nPlan, this will require RT peer and domain agreement on workflow and changes.<BR><BR>2009-09-15 - Sherry Ellis - Spoke with Janet Margolis and Barbara Sheldon about this request.  Discussed the proposed workflow for this request.  Barbara Sheldon is requesting updated screen shots of proposed smart group to discuss with the Respiratory Therapy Leads meeting October 9th.  She understands that my recommendation is to embed a smart group within specialty/ selected order sets vs. her original request for a stand alone order set (for 2 orders).  After agreement from Barbara S. after her October 9th meeting, it will be necessary to vet this request among HBS, ICU, and ED domain groups.  Then I will need to request a new EAP record that says \"Request RT to perform Sputum Induction\" this will route to the \"respiratory section\" of the PER (after consultation with Stephanie Gavigan we are unable to route it to the nursing comm section) with a frequency of per comments so Nursing may release this order if they are unable to obtain a sputum specimen and it will route to the RT inbasket pool.  The orders for hypertonic saline cannot be pre selected because a clinical decision needs to be made if the patient has Pneumocystis (for 3% solution), the details of the hypertonic saline orders should be as needed one time for sputum induction.<BR><BR>2009-09-15 - Sherry Ellis - Sent new screen shots today.<BR><BR>2009-11-05 - Sherry Ellis - Sent email to Barbara Sheldon and Janet Margolis inquiring to the status of this request following their Oct 9th regional RT meeting.<BR><BR>2009-12-02 - Sherry Ellis - Recieved email from Janet Margolis and Barbara Sheldon on 11/24/09 with further enhancements to SR per Dr. Maurice Franco.  Replied to email today advising them that the number of sputum collections is done at the order level as well as the hour frequency that they would like (see attachement dated today).  If additional respiratory micro labs are desired, Janet (or site support) to update this SR with requested labs.  THH will then forward request to domain leads (HBS, ED , ICU) and direct questions to Janet and Dr. Franco.<BR><BR>2009-12-02 - Tina H Hamilton - Screen shots and list of labs sent to domain leads for a final approval of labs per each order set. Also, noted Remedy note requesting different hypersal for pedi CF patients so need to circle back to pharmacy to verify that the build as shown is OK for pedi CF.\nPlan, if Adult domains approve build and labs on all listed order sets, send for review and comment this month, for HCG 1/20/10.<BR><BR>2009-12-02 - Tina H Hamilton - email Christina Shih; I think I said I thought the EDs would rarely use this but it was okay to add.  Could it be collapsed?didng the labs are okay, we would use the AFB and fungal, for instance.

There will be decision support language instead that states that Zocor is preferred at 40-80 mg unless there is renal dysfunction.  Emily is working on restrictor logic that would eliminate the higher doses of Zocor if a patient had an elevated creatinine.  This is different from what is in the ischemic stroke orderset which defaults the dose to 80 mg and does not contain a hard stop.  My preference is to use the same section in the ischemic stroke orderset as in the cardiac ordersets.  Im not sure I see any reason for it in the subarachnoid hemorrhage orderset).\n\n4)  The ACE/ARB section will be added to the CHF, ACS, and Post- PCI ordersets.  There is a hardstop for both ACE and ARB but \"no LV dysfunction\" is available as an option for reason not ordered.  \n\nPhil, \nthe original intention for the ACE/ARB section was for the CHF and ACS ordersets when this was originally brought forward to HBS and Med-Surg Domain.  We can hold off from adding it to the PCI orderset if you want to discuss it further with your group.  Please let Tina know today if that is the case otherwise the communication will go out with PCI included.\n<BR><BR>2009-03-11 - Tina H Hamilton - email Phil Lee\nI am OK with everything below. lets include ace/arb section on post-PCI order sets.  the documentation is likely important since HBS or other physicians may be less likely to see post pci pts in the hospital prior to discharge. if we get alot of feedback later, well reassess.\n\nfor Jeff Klingman and others: heres the rationale of decision support language from Cardiology perspective:\n\nive coordinated the statin language with Eleanor Levin, representing the PHASE group. here is the rationale for 40-80 mg dosing recommendation.\n\n--we really want to push for 80  mg daily whenever possible (to get those LDLs down!)\n--a lower dose (of 40 mg or 20 mg daily) should be started for elderly and those with MILD renal insufficiency\n--we already have language in decision support re: when to use pravachol and what to do in setting of severe renal insufficiency\n\nwe have 80 mg zocor order ranked 1st to promote that practice\n--40 mg option is 2nd for those pts where physicians are concerned\n--alternative drugs and doses below those\n\nAgreement on this language seems consistent with our practice without having SO MUCH decision support that no one will read it.<BR><BR>2009-05-14 - Tina H Hamilton - SR forwarded to Kamran Sahrakar for final determination of subarachnoid order set.<BR><BR>2009-06-24 - Tina H Hamilton - Reviewed draft build within Neurosurg Supplemental Order set with Neurosurgeons. changes: \nAdjust infusion rate inst (CVP 5-10, PAD 13 -20)\nMedications; Add Normal Saline IVF, 80 mL/hour\nOral meds; add NG route as option\n\nPlan; circulate changes 6/26/09<BR><BR>2009-09-04 - Thomas Chun - k.sahrakar approves build - schedule for nov hcg as an update to supplemental neuro os.<BR><BR>2009-11-02 - Gail L Gordon Gaskins - planned HCG changed to 12/16/09, planned release to 1/26/10, build incomplete.<BR><BR>2009-11-11 - Gail L Gordon Gaskins - Changed to medium level of governance change since these changes are in place for other order sets.

This will relieve the need for a hard stop in orders. \n\nPer Herb Szeto\nIm in agreement with this change.  We asked for the removal of the question altogether we we wrote these ordersets and never got a satisfactory reason of why it is required.  The result level that triggers a call for a critical value is independent of whether the patient is on warfarin and Im not aware that the lab processes the speciment any differently based on the answer.  In any case, we probably need to understand why this question is being asked in the first place to address Phils comment.  Id personally prefer - On warfarin and No warfarin therapy since it would include everyone, but can live with the current options if it means not having to go back through HCG.\n\n\n\n\nRationale per Philip Lee\n\nthis is certainly ok for all order sets that I work on/am responsible for.\n\nthe term \"no anticoagulants\" may be misleading...what they really mean is \"not on warfarin\"....however, they could be on other anticoagulants like lovenox which does not affect the INR...and it is still appropriate to check that button.\n\ni think it is fine re: PT/INR orders.\n\nwe should not be ordering any aPTT labs anymore. it has been my intent to review order sets with aPTT to see if most (if not all) can be removed).\n\nin KPNC, we no longer use aPTT to follow heparin dosing...rather, anti-Xa assay for this. as a result, no baseline aPTT needs to be drawn either.\n\nthere is a rare time that we will check a baseline aPTT in evaluation for hypercoagulable state, but this is relatively uncommon and can be ordered ala carte when needed.',NULL,'1260307365ï££W508677ï££Status changed to WorkInProgress as Task CHG000004284081 has begun work.ï£¢',NULL,NULL,'2009-02-11 - Tina H Hamilton - PMO notes imported\nAs shown on HCG approved changes for Arrythmia ED orderset.

It looks to me like it crosses the interface and gets picked up and presented with returned results.  Thus on the patient below I can see the result of the PT/INR and that the patient is anticoagulated on warfarin.  This is probably a good thing, so we dont have to search elsewhere for this important info. \n\nI recommend that we ask Herb to do what the ED has done and have orders that fill in the 2 most common options so the docs do not get stopped and have to - those would be PT/INR Baseline and PT/INR on Warfarin.\n\nSee my screenshot below to see what I am talking about on the results side.

Tom Lorey can give formal approval if that is what is needed by whatever process he feels is necessary here.  I think that if Herb and the ED Suite lead (cannot remember his name right now) agree, then probably worth doing this for all.  Tom Lorey the regional lab director is now leading the lab group and I am a part of his team, so I do not want to overstep here.\n\n\nI agree with Tom - baseline or none is probably best.  Maybe \"baseline\" is not so bad because it is fairly noncommital and would be closest to the idea of \"no warfarin\".  Probably covers 99% of the clinical scenarios that we care about.\n\n(For example:  Patients with DIC or severe liver disease with abnormal PT/INR would then have something that showed that their values were measured on no anticoagulation).<BR><BR>2009-04-01 - Tina H Hamilton - Note to Herb Szeto copying distribution list to confirm which lab orders are impacted; accompanied with screen shot of PT EAP record associated with varying display names (PT, PT/INR, etc). Are we now substituting PT with INR or only making this change when the display name is TP/INR or INR?<BR><BR>2009-04-01 - Tina H Hamilton - email Dave Levy\nI think that the key is that all single orders need to be replaced by 2 possibilities - PT/INR on warfarin and PT/INR on no warfarin therapy - as long as both of those choices replace a single choice on every order set, then I think we are ok and have made progress, allowing the clinician to answer the question by selecting proper choice instead of having to be stopped and answer the question\n\nApproved by Tom Lorey<BR><BR>2009-04-01 - Tina H Hamilton - secondary note per Phil Lee\nAlso, Phil asked if we could float the secondary request to the group, and that is, to review all ordersets and remove the aPTT and PTT orders as obtaining this baseline is no longer clinically useful (except in the case of hypercoagulapathy so on ordersets specific for that, leave the aPTT or PTT orders).\nIf this is agreed by the domains, we could do a consistent across the domain review of ordersets and update. \nThis may be considered a HIGH level change since it involves removing content that has been approved. We would need to circulate for review and comment and bring to the HCG after the domains agreed to this change.\n\nPhil Lee\nas a point of clarification, for KPNC, we NO LONGER use PTT to adjust heparin dosing. Rather, we use anti-Xa. \n\nAs a reflex (ie fall back to previous practices), physicians routinely check off PT/INR and PTT....in case heparin might be used later. there is no value in checking baseline PTT (or anti-Xa for that matter) prior to initiation of heparin. \n\nthis is the rationale for the suggestion.\n\n(This is a high level change that will require a separate SR.

Ive had a few occasions to use it, and the paper is ready and waiting at the IT printer.  Hopefully we wont have any more remodelling :)\n\nNow that thats done, we have another request, one which may be felt to be an enhancement, but one we know is possible, as they have this capability in Hawaii.  Im going to attach an e-mail from Christina Shih to Britt Matern and Andre Santana sent 3 months ago; item #2 is the one Im discussing here (but the others are also languishing).\n\nEssentially what wed like is a button for the \"Class\" field, to be able to click \"Outside Fill\" instead of having to click on the little magnifying glass and select it via scrolling down.  If you look at the screenshot, it actually may not be exactly what we want here (though may be OK).  In our current functionality, the default setting is to \"Discharge\"-- this may be the same as \"Fill Now\".  Whatever the case, we really only need two options:  Discharge (or Fill Now), and Outside Fill.  The default setting should remain \"Discharge\".\n\nThe above represents current functionality which we would like, and the MDs here and ones I interact with regionally cant understand (from a technological standpoint) why Hawaii is able to have this and Northern CA does not.\n\nHaving said the above, in a perfect world we would like to be able to hit one button only for all meds ordered as outpatient prescriptions, without having to open up each medication to change it to \"Outside Fill\" in such laborious fashion.  This adds up if you have someone who tells you theyve run out of the 8 medications they take on a daily basis, and could you please refill them, but give me a paper prescription please?

The synopsis is a build creted in lead and propagates down to all instances, meaning that all instances have the same build. Currently none of the instances have what is being requested. If the requester can provide screenshots of the differences listed in the SR it would be useful for further investigation. I have attachted a screenshot of both the lead configuration and the view in Hyperspace. Referring back for review or further information.<BR><BR>2009-03-24 - Denise M Seymour - Per current findings, this SR is being sent back to the requesting facility via Site Support. Since we cannot identify where this change is partially implemented, Regional domain approval is required in order for us to implement.

Still need to be test before building it to PROD.<BR><BR>2009-01-26 - Jeremy D Vang - 90% of \"Orthopedic Brief Operative Note\" in training.  However, I ran into two issues for \"Pre-Op Diagnosis Codes\" and \"Post-Op Diagnosis Codes\".  They both were requested to pull in, \"SEPTIC BACTERIAL ARTHRITIS OF KNEE [711.06C]\".  I asked Sherry if this smart link exits and if this request was possible and she explained that we cannot pull in the CPT code, which belongs to Ambulatory.  However, we do have a smart link to pull in IP hospital problem list.  My next step is to reach out to Maggie to see if the IP Hospital Problem List can substitute for the SEPTIC BACTERIAL ARTHRITIS OF KNEE [711.06C]?<BR><BR>2009-01-30 - Jeremy D Vang - Email to Maggie: \"Hi Maggie,\n\nHow are you?\nIm one of the AC builder with Sherry Ellis on the ClinCon team.  I have a request from Dr. John Woll at  WCR, requesting for a new smart text called, Orthopaedic Brief Operative Note, similar to Brief OP Note.  I was building this smart text and came to a road block on two smart links, which require your assistant?  \n\nDr. Woll is asking to pull in a smartlink, SEPTIC BACTERIAL ARTHRITIS OF KNEE for Pre & Post-Op Diagnoses Codes as indicated below in orange.  I spoke with Sherry if it was possible to pull in the code as a link.  She said, we cannot pull in Ambulatory CPT codes into a smart text.  Sherry, also suggested for me to contact you to see if we can use what we currently have, HPROBL(Hospital Problems) or if you know a work around to his request?   At the end of the memo, is the original word doc and please feel free to edit the doc as need.\"<BR><BR>2009-02-03 - Jeremy D Vang - Received feed back from Maggie: \"The only thing that is different, or that we wouldnt want to do to .opnote brief is adding the tourniquet time.  Is there any way to have this in the note but have it not show up if there is nothing documented?\n\nHe does not want to pull in ambulatory diagnoses, all he wants to do is get rid of the text that says Preop diagnosis, because the link has preop diagnosis in it, same with the text(s) that say post op diagnosis and procedure with laterality and surgeon and assistant.  This ends up with duplicates as you can see in his screen shot.\n\nWould not add yes as default to the dictation piece...  Other than that, the changes should be made to .opnotebrief.  \n\nLet me know about tourniquet time and if it can be hidden if empty.  If so, we are back to one note for all.\"<BR><BR>2009-04-30 - Jeremy D Vang - Smart text was built in training. Dont have a test pt and log for testing the tourniquet time.  Found a test pt and test log in WITZ2. Need to rebuild the smart text in WITZ to further test if the tourniquet time can be hidden if no value is input into the OR_RPT_LOG_UI_EQUIPMENT.\n\nTest pt: MRN# 456786885, Benelli Hunter\nLog#: 514\n<BR><BR>2009-06-26 - Jeremy D Vang - Met w/ Sherry 6/24. After testing tourniquet time in WITS3, the new note from activity tool bar still NOT carrying over the tourniquet values, which entered into the log. \n\n6/26 - sent email to optime, requesting for new case/log.  Once, receive the case/log, then test the note within the log and NOT from activity to see if the tourniquet values appear on note.\n<BR><BR>2009-07-02 - Jeremy D Vang - Test case #36805 in GGM instance.  Entered tourniquet date and time to inflation and deflation and accepted the note.   Went to test the dot phrase \".ORTOURNTIME\" in a regular note, inside a pt chart.  NO results came through, then went to test the same dot phrase inside the note in the log and the results came through. (see attachment \"General\" for my findings).<BR><BR>2009-07-24 - Jeremy D Vang - Sent email to Epic email, asking why tourniquet time is ONLY able to pull inside the log and NOT outside the log?  Epics response, \"The OpTime SmartLinks work by finding the first surgical log that is linked to the admission (Hospital Chart) that the user is accessing.  In this test case, there are multiple logs (ORL records) linked to this patients Hospital Encounter, and the SmartLink only displays information for the first one, which is actually ORL 36813.  If you would document tourniquet information in that log, it should display in the SmartLink.  I hope that helps, let me know if you have additional questions.\"\n\nNext step is to retest tourniquet time to see if results carry over within same encounter like epic mentioned.\n<BR><BR>2009-08-06 - Jeremy D Vang - 8/6/06 - Next step need to have lead show and test to see if theres a (null) value and retest the tourniquet time.<BR><BR>2009-08-20 - Jeremy D Vang - 8/20/09 - Got replied from Chris Russell. \"Unfortunately, there are no parameters available in the ORTOURNTIME SmartLink.  We can make an enhancement request for such a parameter in our next release.\" \n\nNext step:  Need to continue building a new \"Orthopedic Brief Operative Note\" and informed Maggie about epics finding.\n\n8/19/09 - Sherry and I tried to find paramaters on the back end to see if we have add a \"null\" value around tourniquet time.  We have NO success and contacted Chris Russel from EPIC.  He will get back to us.\n<BR><BR>2009-08-26 - Jeremy D Vang - 8/26/09 - Send email to Maggie to see if we continue / deny with Dr. Wolls request due to no parameters to hide the \"tourniquet time\" if value is empty.  Or deny his request and reach out to epic to enhance parameters on the tourniquet time to have a \"null\" value and not have anything relating to tourniquet show up if empty values.<BR><BR>2009-09-24 - Jeremy D Vang - 9/24/09 - Finished building in wits3 lead #50349 - Orthopaedic Brief Operative Note and send screen shot to Dr. Woll for review.<BR><BR>2009-10-09 - Jeremy D Vang - 10/9/09 - Called and left a voicemail on cell phone around 3PM.<BR><BR>2009-11-05 - Jeremy D Vang - 11/05/09 - Meet with Dr. Woll via  phone and  webex.

Since itâ€™s shared with ICU, replace with an age specific one or hide it. \nYoko to add this to the RN Pre-Domain Nursing Peer Group meeting where it will be discussed further.  Yoko to invite Andrea Thorup (HC rep to Critical Care Domain) to attend. \n\nOn March 12, Catherine D Parsons (NICU Domain Co-Chair) sent an email to Yoko: \nYes, this is an issue.

Comment from BP\n\"The DKA protocol makes reference to the hypoglycemia protocol and is consistent in that it starts with a blood sugar less than 70.  It should be an easy fix and should not need to go to HCG since we are not changing the intent as long as everyone agrees.  We should also add this to the HONK orderset to be consistent.\"<BR><BR>2009-09-10 - Gail L Gordon Gaskins - Clarification of note from 9/8/09.

Sent him screen shot.  Dr. Szeto replied and request for web link.  Per Minh replied, \"With the revisions, the revised CIWA order set will be completely different from the current one.  So we treat it like a brand new build.  We will retire the current one when this new build is released. The dosing per CIWA a lot simpler and were able to incorporate all needed information within the orders.  So we thought that there is not a need for a protocol.  Basically the RN will know what dose to give based on CIWA score.  Perhaps the nursing member of the domain can take a look.\"\n\nAlso, made minor changes to ACTIVE ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL TREATMENT ONLY(CIWA score less than or equal to 8). In decision support change from \"BOTH\" to \"ALL\", added MEASURE VITAL SIGNS order w/ \"Every 4 hours\" in comment, and added verbiage to SPECIAL OBSERVATION VITAL SIGNS in comment with, \"Initiate and adjust Benzodiazepine dose according to CIWA Score.

Awaiting response regarding the following:\n1) Do you want the physicians to acknowledge the inclusion and exclusion criteria by putting a hard stop?  (similar to tpa order set where you would have to answer Yes or No to each criteria)\n\n2) Do we want more specific titration information for nurses on fentanyl, versed, and cisatracurium infusions in the admin instruction (something similar to ven-sed order set)? \n\n3) Just to clarify, are the morphine, versed, and vecuronium IV push orders to be used ONLY prior to getting the infusion started?  Then would it make more sense to build these like a one-time dose as a bolus prior to starting the infusion rather than using \"q1h prn\" or \"q30min prn\" frequencies and stating in the admin instruction \"discontinue during rewarming phase\"? \n\n<BR><BR>2009-07-27 - Jung M Lee - No response on the build questions yet.

This is too novel, and yet some physicians may stretch the indications (like using it on gravid patients, which has been done with good results). We havent done hard stops with sepsis or HAMP ordersets... I wouldnt use them here.\n\nI can agree to std fentanyl and midazolam rates - like 25mcg/hr and 2 mg/hr. That would probably work for 80%.\nThe morphine, versed and vec were supposed to be \"ED IVP only\" so the one-time dose approach might work out fine. If they dont start the gtts in an hour, though it might pose a problem, and an hour goes by quickly in the ED or ICU. Is there was an option to preset the order for q 1hr prn 2 doses each ? That would be better, if possible.<BR><BR>2009-07-31 - Jeremy D Vang - Jung and I are about 80% completed.  Still fine tuning the meds and lab with Dr. Marelich.  Next step, waiting for EAP to be activated and send protocol for URL.<BR><BR>2009-08-04 - Jung M Lee - Resending protocol document to Dr Marelich for review.  Modified original protocol document to include additional IVP medications (versed, morphine, vecuronium) and recommending to include specific rates to the sed/hyp/nmba infusion orders specified in the protocol.<BR><BR>2009-08-06 - Jung M Lee - Protocol document reviewed by Dr Marelich.  Response from Dr Marelich:\ncould you please be sure to change the fentanyl gtt to 25 mcg/hr fixed dose, and the midazolam gtt to 2 mg/hr fixed dose in the orders? I see that its been changed in the protocol checklist.\n\nI agree with your edit,\"Witnessed cardiac arrest or known down time less than 15 min (defined as time from cardiac arrest onset to initiation of ACLS, excluding bystander CPR or “found down” of unknown duration)\"\n\nI like what you did with the morphine/midazolam/vec for the ED. Thats very practical now.\n\nSince I submitted this for build, the regional critical care group was shooting for glucose control under 140; we are now shooting for under 180 due to more recent literature. \nCan you please change the Call Physician order AND the protocol document to reflect this higher value?<BR><BR>2009-08-06 - Jung M Lee - Emailed Dr Marelich again for clarification on sed/analg rates.  Also getting clarification on NMBA monitoring for nursing.<BR><BR>2009-08-11 - Jung M Lee - Response from Dr Marelich:\n\n1. Practically, we arent giving instructions on how long to titrate midaz and fent to RASS<-3 prior to cisatracurium start, and I dont want to spend a whole bunch of time doing it either. How about changing the protocol from:\n\nCURRENT:\n? Start Midazolam infusion at 2 mg/hr and Fentanyl infusion at 25 mcg/hr. Once adequate doses are established to RASS< -3, determine TOF.  Start Cisatracurium infusion at 2 mcg/kg/hr, titrating to TOF ¼.  \n\nPROPOSED CHANGE:\n? Start Midazolam infusion at 2 mg/hr and Fentanyl infusion at 25 mcg/hr and rapidly adjust to goal of RASS< -3, then start Cisatracurium infusion at 2 mcg/kg/hr, titrating to TOF ¼.  Once Cisatracurium infusion started, maintain rate of Midazolam and Fentanyl infusions.  \n\nI am pretty sure that will do the trick. \n\n2. All ICUs, in my opinion, should have a NMBA policy about using TOF for titration, theres no other practical way to do it. \n\n3. We ought to have the NG tube order present (but un-checked, as a large number of pts will come through the ED and have an order there or with the admit order set). Can you slip the NG tube order in after the PO meds so that physicians will realize that an enteral route is needed?\n\nWill modify the order set based on his response.\n<BR><BR>2009-08-11 - Tina H Hamilton - TIGR review, confirmed plans for review and comment following sponsor approval; HCG 9/22/09.<BR><BR>2009-08-11 - Jung M Lee - Plan for full screen shot to Dr Marelich tomorrow.

Response:\n\nCriteria\n\"Return of normal rhythm from cardiac arrest (VF, pulseless VT, asystole, PEA) less than 30 minutes\" is an improvement, but how about using the more common clinical terminology, \"Return of spontaneous circulation within 30 minutes of cardiac arrest\" ?\n\nNotification/Call If\nFirst two orders, \"degree\" should be \"degrees\"\nThird order, \"... for potassium less than 3.2 (goal potassium = 3.5 or greater during cooling)\" could be, \"...for potassium during cooling less than 3.2 (goal potassium during cooling is 3.5 or greater)\"\n\nMeds\nlook good to me, thanks for working in the NG tube\n\nLabs\nAll labs should be checked.\nLabs for start of protocol - are they preset to 1 occurrence each?

Note to Jeremy Vang,  Please spell out the full text for HME on the order set and protocol wherever it appears:\nHeat moisture exchanger (HME)\n<BR><BR>2009-11-06 - Gail L Gordon Gaskins - TC from Lorna Yamaguchi to Tina HH:  ED is impacted by this order set and they need to review prior to bring this order set to HCG.  Also, this orderset refers to a \"Temperature Directed Cooling Device\" that not all KP Centers have.  Ambulance companies will start diverting Cardiac Arrest patients to hospitals that have this device so KP Patients may be going to Non-KP hospitals for expensive treatment.  Lorna wants to be sure PCS and Barbara Norrish to be aware of this situation.\n\nEmail to Rob Norris asking him to review, then we will send to ED Domain for review and comment.  Email to K. Cagney explaining situation with Temp. Directed Cooling Device and asking her to work with PCS to be sure they are aware of this.  \n\nPlanned HCG date changed to 12/16/09 and planned release date moved to 1/26/10.<BR><BR>2009-11-10 - Tina H Hamilton - Rob Norris responded to initial review of screen shots with recommendations for changes. Lorna Yamaguchi indicates that she is awaiting ICU input and will then send changes. Changes to be made before this is sent for review and comment.<BR><BR>2009-11-16 - Tina H Hamilton - ED respondent, Rob Norris and Greg Marelich exchanging comments. A text extraction from the draft KPHC build was sent to ICU sponsors with a request that they edit this document to clarify for builders exactly what changes are desired. If received by 11/18, will make every effort to send for review and comment in prep for 12/16 HCG.<BR><BR>2009-11-17 - Tina H Hamilton - ED comments added to text/word file in email chain by Rob Norris. Acknowledged and requested that Critical care sponsors update with specifics esp changes bulleted in email that require formatting, etc.<BR><BR>2009-11-20 - Gail L Gordon Gaskins - Planned HCG changed to 1/26/10, need new build document from sponsor.<BR><BR>2009-11-23 - Gail L Gordon Gaskins - New build document added as attachment.<BR><BR>2009-11-24 - Tina H Hamilton - Per Lorna Yamaguchi, synonyms\nICU\nED\nCardiac Arrest\nArrest\nHypothermia\nTHACA \nPost-cardiac arrest\n<BR><BR>2009-11-24 - Jeremy D Vang - 11/24/09 - Added synonyms per Lornas request. ICU, ED, Cardiac Arrest, Arrest, and Post-cardiac arrest.  Hypothermia and THACA synonms already exist in during initial build.<BR><BR>2009-11-24 - Tina H Hamilton - Added updated protocol document with typo fixed by Greg Marelich.<BR><BR>2009-11-27 - Jung M Lee - Sent final screenshot to Dr Marelich for review for next weeks icu domain mtg.  Set to go to Jan HCG.<BR><BR>2009-12-03 - Jeremy D Vang - 11/29/09 - updated Per Dr. Marelich additional request:\n-Will \"Orders\" in the title be removed? I thought the title was to be, \"Therapeutic Hypothermia After Cardiac Arrest Protocol ICU\"\n-For the midazolam and Propofol choice - should we add a little help text, like \"Choose one\" ?\n-Should we pre-check the Insert NG Tube\" order, and change it to \"Insert NG Tube if not already done\" ? (like we did with the foley)\n-The CBCs with differentials in the Labs Per Comment Multiple Occurrences and the Labs - Every AM sections can be CBCs without differentials but should be prechecked. \n-We need an additional prechecked order in the Labs Per Comment Multiple Occurrences section, one for a RANDOM GLUCOSE, send STAT to confirm POCT glucose <80 mg/dL.\n-\"Home Medical Equipment\" in the protocol (appears two times, during cooling and rewarming) should be, \"Heat and Moisture Exchanger\" both times.\n-To make the orders agree with the protocol, would add two more prechecked orders for Next Morning; 1) portable CXR in am, \"f/u cardiac arrest\" (if you can preload comments into Radiology orders) and 2) EKG in am.\n-Can you add to the Users & Departments affected, \"Emergency Dept Physicians\"? I think our decision was to include, \"ED\" in the synonyms.<BR><BR>2009-12-03 - Jeremy D Vang - 12/3/09 - updated per Dr. Marelich request and sent screen shot v10.\n\nI am in my Critical Care Domain mtg right now, and the group has made two additional requests:\nfor the Measure Temperature order, change, \"If patient is anuric...\" to \"If patient is anuric, use alternate continuous core temperature monitoring.\"\nfor the abbreviation of \"TOF\" please spell it out instead: \"train of four\"<BR><BR>2009-12-03 - Jeremy D Vang - 12/3/09 - New SR created for \"Change EDP order Speech Therapy [45] order config (OCC) to look like Physical Therapy [42].  Add \"Questions\" to (OCC) for ONLY at the orderset level.\"  Emailed Adam and cc Trevor for IA.<BR><BR>2009-12-07 - Jeremy D Vang - 12/4/09 - Per Dr. Yamaguchi, \" The ICU Regional Chiefs and managers  meeting is on 12/10.  Ill also show the screen shots and distribute  paper version of the orderset that will be presented at HCG on 12/16 so the facilities can begin planning implementation.  This is probably the most complicated orderset weve attempted since it spans 36 hours. \nEGDT is only 6 hours.   i want the facilities to have as much lead time as possible.  Even if the HCG does not approve, the substance of the orderset will hopefully remain intact with only minor content changes requested.\"\n12/4/09 - \" Whoops - one more thing to add - can you put back the open bullets in the lab section to help the nurses with the handoff?\"\n12/03/09 - Per Dr. Marelich, \"In the Measure Temperature order again, please remove the phrase contained by the parentheses - \"(e.g. Rectal probe)\" Sorry that wasnt clear, I should have typed the whole thing out. The request at the domain was to remove mention of rectal probes altogether, as there are potentially better alternatives. Otherwise - Great!\"\n<BR><BR>2009-12-07 - Jeremy D Vang - 12/7/09 - Sent screen shot v11 to sponsor.<BR><BR>2009-12-07 - Gail L Gordon Gaskins - Per Tina HH:  The order set will be presented to the HCG 12/16/09.\nAny recommendations from the HCG will be incorporated into the final build sent to MECs on 12/23, with an announced planned release date of 1/26/10*.\n* Question; operationally, it is not clear if all sites will have the required equipment by 1/26/10. Lorna states that she is aware of expedited approval to purchase equipment for 5 sites. \nSCL and GSAA have the equipment and are requesting expedited release; If SCL and GSAA request expedited release prior to 1/26/10, the technical option and precendence does exist for release in restricted facilities. We can arrange for them to obtain and confirm local MEC approval before 1/26/10 and can release the order set to the SCL and GSAA facilities specifically as needed to avoid ambulance bypass.\n<BR><BR>2009-12-08 - Gail L Gordon Gaskins - Hi Jeremy,\nHere are a few more minor changes (I hope) to the Therapeutic Hypothermia Order Set.\n1. Add ED to the title, so it becomes \"Therapeutic Hypothermia After Cardiac Arrest Protocol ICU and ED\"\n2. Add 2 blank Nursing Communication Orders\n3. Add these synonyms:\nCardiac Arrest\nArrest\nHypothermia\nTHACA \nPost-cardiac arrest<BR><BR>2009-12-08 - Jeremy D Vang - 12/8/09 - Updated orderset w/ the changes below and sent new screen shot v12 to gov.<BR><BR>2009-12-11 - Jung M Lee - Went through pre-HCG mtg with Dr Mehta yesterday.  The follow-up from this meeting is Dr Marelich did not want other anticoagulants (heparin, arixtra) added to dvt ppx section.  Will go ahead with the build as is.<BR><BR>2009-12-16 - Gail L Gordon Gaskins - Approved by HCG with this change:  For all temperatures in the order set and the protocol, use format of Â°C (Â°F).  \nScheduled for release 1/26/10.<BR><BR>2009-12-21 - Jeremy D Vang - 12/21/09 - updated all temperatures in the orderset and protocol with the format of Â°C (Â°F) from HCG and send screen shot to Gov.<BR><BR>2009-12-22 - Trevor M Pratt - Status changed to WorkInProgress as Task CHG000004352692 has begun work.<BR><BR>',1068,1068,NULL,NULL,NULL),(2523,0,'N',1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Herb Szeto','',3425701,NULL,'Change to All Standard Admission Ordersets:  Build restriction locator smartgroup and add to all these ordersets.',NULL,'OS',NULL,'0',NULL,'0','L','R','H','D','Protein, Albumin, BPA, Restrictor Locator, Calorie, Malnutrition',NULL,NULL,'','',NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,'NICE','Res','0','KPHC CN IP ORDERSETS',NULL,'End User Applications','KPHC Inpatient MD/CRNA/Midwife Content','Order Set - MD','','M','N','N',' ',NULL,'NR',' ','N','MEDSURG','0','0','0','0','0','0','0',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-04-15 08:44:18','2009-03-04 14:44:06',' ',NULL,NULL,'','',NULL,'','','',1018,NULL,201,201,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-03-10 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-03-13 08:56:00','2009-04-14 11:01:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Change to All Standard Admission Ordersets:  Build restriction locator smartgroup and add to all these ordersets.\n\nBuild restriction locator smartgroup and add to all Standard Admission ordersets.

removal of CK-MB and aPTT/PTT\n\nSelective replacement of CK and CK-MB orders with troponin order:\nWe were asked by Regional Lab to review the order sets to develop consistency with KPNC ACS Guideline regarding cardiac markers used to assess for myocardial injury and myocyte necrosis (i.e. myocardial infarction). Historically, CK and CK-MB have been the markers used. In 2007, the Joint European Society of Cardiology-ACC-AHA-World Health Federation Task Force established troponin as the biomarker of choice for this purpose. The KPNC Acute Coronary Syndrome Team has also adopted this perspective.\n\nAs such, in general, the order sets should be reviewed to see where it is appropriate to replace the orders for CK and CK-MB, with troponin. This is especially relevant for post-surgical patients where there is a greater likelihood that elevations in CK and CK-MB are the result of skeletal muscle injury rather than myocardial injury. For some cardiac patients, it is reasonable to leave the option of ordering CK and CK-MB since this may supplement \"sizing\" of an MI (when used in conjunction with troponin I measurement).\n\nElimination of aPTT or PTT orders as a \"routine\" baseline measurement OR as a method to monitor efficacy of heparin:\nRequest is to review all ordersets and remove the aPTT and PTT orders as obtaining this baseline is no longer clinically useful (except in the case of clinical concern about hypercoagulable state....on ordersets specific for that, leave the aPTT or PTT orders, though should change to ONE standardized way of naming it: either aPTT or PTT).   In KPNC, we NO LONGER use PTT to adjust heparin dosing. Rather, we use anti-Xa. \n\nAs a reflex (ie fall back to previous practices), physicians routinely check off PT/INR and PTT for many patients (e.g. preop, on admission to hospital, etc)....in case heparin might be used later.

These orders are more time consuming and prone to error if not standardized.  \nThis order set will improve Peri-Op efficiency in several ways:\n1. By decreasing the time surgeons spend on discharge orders, case turnover will be improved.\n2. By standardizing discharge meds and doses, they will get to the discharge pharmacy more reliably and with less errors requiring pharmacy call backs and patients will be discharged sooner without delays.\n3.

Adding the midline catheter insertion to the PICC orderset facilitates the ordering of a midline catheter.

I havent had time until now to review and update the order set. \n\nMinh:  The insulin pump order set is based on the carb counting order set already in place with adjustments in order to use it in pump patients. Enclosed is an updated version of the insulin pump order set. The insulin pump order set has been approved by the Regional Endocrine group.   Please see my comments in green below.\n\nAs part of the insulin pump orders, I also wanted to include the contraiindications under the Notes section in the orders:\n\nNOTES\nNote:\n  Use this order set only for insulin treated patients who are using the insulin pump for insulin therapy\nCONTRAINDICATIONS TO PUMP THERAPY\n*Patient with altered state of consciousness\n*Critically ill patient (e.g. sepsis, trauma) requiring intensive care\n*Patient at risk for suicide\n*Patient refuses or otherwise unable to participate in own care\n*Family member, friend, or significant other refuses or is otherwise unable to \n      participate in care if patient is unable to participate in own care\n*Other circumstances identified by the physician\n\nPamela Kershner, M.D.\n\n\n\nNancy Ichiuji/CA/KAIPERM\n05/08/2009 08:15 AM	\nTo\nMinh Nguyen/CA/KAIPERM@Kaiperm\n\nRe: Fw: continuous SUBQ insulin pump\n	\nThe SFO Diabetes Management Group has been working on a P&P and an order set for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). Dr Pamela Kersher from WCR has been working on a REGIONAL order set. I have cc her as well.\n\nI have attached the drafts of our P&P and order set\n\nTo answer your questions:\n1.  Are you looking to start the patients on the pump in house?  \nNo -  only patients who are on insulin pumps at home will be continued on insulin pumps in the hospital  \nYes, but rarely (we purchased a pump for the hospital).  We have started a few patients on the pump but they have usually been patients who have been hospitalized for a long time with unpredictable blood sugars and this was the only way we could stabilize their sugars well enough to be able to discharge them.\n2.  Are the patients to use their own pump?  If so, do you have (not sure if needed) a policy around this?\nPatients will use their own pump and provide all necessary equipment (pump, batteries, tubing). Patient will sign an agreement with conditions for using the pump. See attached  P&P and agreement.\nAgreed.\n3.  Are the patients doing their own pump programming?\nPatients will determine their insulin dose based on the doctors orders ( __ units of insulin per gram of carbs). Doctor will include the basal rate and correction dose in the order set.\nThe pump is usually programmed to their outpatient settings.  Any changes in basal as well as correction doses or carb ratios will have to be ordered by the MD and then either the diabetes RN (if available) or the patient can make the dose changes in the pump.\n\nWe currently do not have a consistent practice for use of the insulin pump. When patients are admitted with an insulin pump, they were usually switched to an insulin sliding scale.

Remove omeprazole from Post PCI order set since post PCI patients typically receive clopidogrel (Plavix) after the procedure. 2. Add TJC core measure options for aspirin ordering \nBackground information/context setting, rationale for change: 1. Recent studies suggest a negative interaction between omeprazole (and possibly other PPIs) and clopidogrel. More specifically, omeprazole appears to decrease the efficacy of clopidogrel, which may increase the risk of acute MI and major adverse cardiac events after PCI. Since nearly all patients require aspirin and clopidogrel after PCI, the option to order omeprazole via this order set is being removed. For patients who require treatment of peptic ulcer disease, H2 blocker is the preferred agent. 2. There is a \"hard stop\" for ordering aspirin (or identifying a contraindication) in this order set. However, aspirin may be ordered outside this order set (e.g. PTA medication). That option has now been included. \nPhysician Sponsor Name: Dr. Philip C Lee \nDomain/SUIT that has approved the content: Cardiology domain lead for inpt HC',NULL,'',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(2591,0,'N',1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','',3643008,NULL,'DO NOT REOPEN THIS   (SR) MCH-Perinatal-OS Oxytocin/IVF Ordersets',NULL,'OS',NULL,'0',NULL,'0','H','0','H','0','',NULL,NULL,'','',NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,'NICE','Res','0','KPHC CN IP ORDERSETS',NULL,'End User Applications','KPHC Inpatient MD/CRNA/Midwife Content','Order Set - MD','','H','N','N',' ',NULL,'AR','N','N','0','0','0','0','0','0','0','0','2009-06-12 15:33:08',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-05-18 08:36:41','2009-05-13 15:37:30',' ',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','','',687,NULL,201,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-05-14 08:30:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'DO NOT REOPEN THIS   (SR) MCH - Perinatal - OS Oxytocin/IVF Orderset.\nPharmacy and PPSP have asked that all oxytocin be standardized to one product.\nBackground: Prior use of 20 units in 1000 ml Ringers Lactate was thought to increase the risk of pitocin being given when not intended and not being given when intended.\n\n(SR) MCH - Perinatal - OS Oxytocin/IVF Orderset. 1.

This task force was just formed at the request of Alan Whippy and the first meeting will be in a couple of weeks. One of the first things this task force will do is exam all the HC orders and workflows related to treatment of the septic patient and make recommendations to optimize workflow and decrease redundancy and other issues. The respective task force members will be expected to take recommendations back to their peers for evaluation and approval. Hopefully this task force can address problems such as what is currently being debated. I am currently the designated representative from ICU.

He agreed that this may work as a section within the existing Adult Transfusion Order set.  There is a regional protocol in the lab for ways of managing massive transfusion needs.  Our workflows would not support the order he writes at the end of the labs to \"discontinue protocol\".  I informed him that ordering the blood products and the lab would in essence be the way the physicians start the protocol, and discontinuing the orders is the way to \"discontinue\" the protocol.  There is no need for supporting hyperlink protocol doccuments, since it is the blood bank/ lab working off of a protocol, and that is not housed in HC.  It should be a simple build, keeping in mind the operations / workflows are for the facilities to resolve.<BR><BR>2009-06-02 - Sherry Ellis - Tiger review:  Since massive transfusion workflows act much like a code blue,  current workflows are done on paper then scanned into HC.

Locke and Ray regarding the Massive Transfusion orderset-- heres what we discussed:\n*  right now, there really isnt a defined \"owner\" of this orderset, nor is there a defined, approval-stamped regional massive transfusion protocol.  The specialty that is furthest along with this is OB; however, an orderset such as this has potential consumers in every single specialty.  Ive agreed to take this on, but will be drafting other core leads such as Jaya, Eric and Steve, and the OpTime crew to chime in, as they will also be users of this orderset.\n*  any regional protocol/pathway needs to get further along before this orderset gets release regionally.  There is an actual document that Dr. Locke sent to me, which Ill take a look at.  This protocol has to be a) agreed upon, and b) folded into the orderset in the form of decision-support and weblinks.\n*  a companion issue is some of the blood-bank orders, particularly FFP.  This order needs to be made more clear to end-users both on the Preference List and in any final orderset\n*  the lab orders need to be better defined-- q30 minutes is too fast, no lab operates that quickly.  Well likely go to some sort of PER PROTOCOL order.\n\nIll tackle this this week; I suspect this orderset will have a somewhat winding path given the various parties who need to participate.\n<BR><BR>2009-10-05 - Tina H Hamilton - Changed status to PLANNING, pending Rob Norris and Stakeholder content finalization. Owner Tina Herrmann Hamilton will follow up and assign back to AC when content is finalized.<BR><BR>2009-10-20 - Tina H Hamilton - Per Rob Norris, he will follow up with OB Alex Locke to see if a regionally approved protocol exists (beyond the blood bank protocol) and what the workflow for OS is. This is not likely to be used in ED (they hang 2 units of O neg and send pt to OR immediately). Still planning, pending content finalization.<BR><BR>2009-11-02 - Tina H Hamilton - 10/27, Rob Norris reports that this primarily affects OB but there is no regionally approved protocol for massive transfusion orders. Rob Norris is asking OB sponsors to discuss regionally approved protocol development.

I think it would be confusing if we use the same terminology for the oral and NSAIDS in this order set.  What type of language will you use to guide the nurse when to give these meds?  I assume they could be given ATC so wouldnt really call them breakthrough, but prns.  I think this also applies to the IV narcotics, unless you want a call when the pt receives 2 or more doses in an 8 hour period.  This may be the best for the IV.\nThe NSAIDs are smart groups.  We can make them show up only as they do in the other pain order sets - none for over certain age or elevated creatinine.  Dont recall off hand what parameters are used on the other pain sets, but Minh or Thomas could tell us.\nRe the Pasero Scale.  There will need to be considerable nursing communication before this goes into production.  Primarily adult services domain, since this will effect the floor/ICU nurses much more than the Periop nurses.  I will defer to Kathy, but this should be very well communicated prior to the change.\n<BR><BR>2009-07-09 - Tina H Hamilton - email Anne Foss Durant: We do not have a lot of epidurals in ICU here at AMC, but they do use the \"PASS\" scale for sedation.  KAthy may be a better resource. \n<BR><BR>2009-07-09 - Tina H Hamilton - FOR Med Surg domain discussion, next mtg<BR><BR>2009-07-27 - Tina H Hamilton - Inquiry to Herb Szeto, Anne Foss-Durant (cc Lorna Yamaguchi and Kathy Cagney) inquiring re: domain approval.<BR><BR>2009-08-10 - Tina H Hamilton - Inquiry Herb Szeto, domain leads, inquiring as to status and next steps<BR><BR>2009-08-11 - Tina H Hamilton - email from Kathy Cagney detailing Regional Epidural Project, policy/procedures, training and goals to maintain epidural pts on Med Surg units (not ICU). Pasero scale is included. Do we need a workgroup of domain and CASD/Epidural Project reps to finalize plans for the order set changes?<BR><BR>2009-08-11 - Tina H Hamilton - Note, per Vicki Casella-Gordon, DSA, a request has been submitted for copyright permission to use Pasero Scale in KPHC>National involved.<BR><BR>2009-08-27 - Tina H Hamilton - Note to Bettianne Wiessler and Barbara Norrish asking for process to keep activity on iNGG, ops and nursing communication open for follow up and eventual approval to build.<BR><BR>2009-09-10 - Tina H Hamilton - follow up email to Barbara Norrish; Bettianne suggests she is the contact, need timeline for PCS and KPHC to approve, so we can target potential order set release date.<BR><BR>2009-09-14 - Gail L Gordon Gaskins - Status changed to pending support partner.<BR><BR>2009-09-14 - Tina H Hamilton - per email, Dr Rudow: Page 4 of my submission> Nursing orders > ETCO2 monitoring > Instead of \"Call Anesthesia for saturation less than **  It should read \"Call Anesthesia for respiratory rate less than *** or ETCO2 greater than ***)\n(Tina HH has added a note to the pdf build document, loaded as new build document.)<BR><BR>2009-10-16 - Tina H Hamilton - 10/16TC w/ Barbara Norrish. Pasero scale requires PCS approval and planning so suggest moving ahead with other changes to order set and then coming back to update pasero scale later. Other changes (do not give orders and related BPAs) are currently being analyzed so EAPs or workflows not yet fully approved or available for revision. Follow up note to Mark Rudow to inquire about what of the remaining changes should be done now.<BR><BR>2009-11-02 - Tina H Hamilton - follow up inquiry to Mark Rudow; plan to work on interim changes until pasero and \"do not give anticoag\" orders are ready, and if so, what changes to vital signs and notify physician are needed?<BR><BR>2009-11-03 - Tina H Hamilton - Mar Rudow asks \"My first thought would be to go ahead with all of the changes except the Pasero Scale and Do Not give orders.  That inclination would be tempered by two considerations.  First, how long will it take to get the Do Not Give and Pasero issues settled?  If we are talking about few weeks, then we should wait.  The other would be whether a physician would have to redo their defaults if the changes were done in two stages.\"\nNote to Sherry, Minh and Stephanie re: timeline for EAPs (new do not give anticoag orders), and what impact revisions will have on saved user defaults. \nPasero will be at least 6 months per Barbara Norrish.<BR><BR>2009-11-12 - Tina H Hamilton - Per Sherry Ellis: After an MD has saved a user order set, when we make changes to the base orderset, they are notified when opening their version the next time.  We indicate for them what the change was so they can either make the change in their version, or clear their defaults and create a new user saved version<BR><BR>',1064,1040,NULL,NULL,NULL),(2620,0,'N',1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Dan Brugger','',3722166,NULL,'Create new Pediatric Pain Order Set',NULL,'OS',NULL,'Stage',NULL,'0','L','N','H','D','Pediatric Pain',NULL,NULL,'','Emily Foo',NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,'NICE','Wor','0','KPHC CN IP ORDERSETS',NULL,'End User Applications','KPHC Inpatient MD/CRNA/Midwife Content','Order Set - MD','','L','N','N',' ',NULL,'NR',' ','N','PED','0','0','0','0','0','0','0',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-12-22 12:05:58','2009-06-08 12:29:16',' ',NULL,NULL,'','',NULL,'','','',988,NULL,201,95,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-06-09 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-06-09 07:37:00','2009-09-03 12:50:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Create new Pediatric Pain Order Set\n\nExtract Pain section from Standard Admission Peds OS to create a new OS.

Unfortunately, the solution is not stable and cannot be stocked without significant wastage. In addition, concerns about the use of IV calcium without cardiac monitoring were raised by pharmacy.

revise pain meds for compliance\n\nThe details of this SR have been received from John Woll via email in response to related SR 3551511 to revise meds across a variety of order sets.\n\nSee \"comments\" for details requested by Dr. Woll\n\nRationale from Dr. Woll:\nThe rationale for change is to allow for weight based ordering and allow the maximum safe analgesic regardless of whether the narcotic or the acetominophen is the limiting component, with additional decision support for the amounts allowable.  Also, new section for valium for relief of muscle spasms (common in femur fractures) has been added.  Same comments for both questions 1 and 2 below.

When the orderset is released by the RN, the patient is in HPS in ADT so the label prints in the PACU. The PACU is nowhere near the CVICU and the labels are getting lost.

Lactates should be drawn on all suspected sepsis patients.\n\nSponsors: SRO\nJoshua Weil, ED\nMonica Minguillon, HBS',NULL,'',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(2695,0,'N',1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','',3898946,NULL,'#KPHC IP2STR143 - Order Sets - MD/PA/CRNA/Midwife - Hospital Admission Order needs to be removed from order set.',NULL,'OS',NULL,'Stage',NULL,'0','L','N','L','S','',NULL,NULL,'','',NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,'NICE','Res','0','KPHC CN IP ORDERSETS',NULL,'End User Applications','KPHC Inpatient MD/CRNA/Midwife Content','Order Set - MD','','L','N','N',' ',NULL,'NR',' ','N','0','0','0','0','0','0','0','0',NULL,NULL,'2009-07-30 10:47:01','2009-07-30 10:48:01','2009-07-30 10:47:13','2009-08-03 08:05:57','2009-07-30 10:45:10',' ','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','','',1018,NULL,95,201,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-07-30 10:55:00','2009-08-17 04:09:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'#KPHC IP2STR143 - Order Sets - MD/PA/CRNA/Midwife - Hospital Admission Order needs to be removed from order set.\n\nOrder set name= Trauma Orders Podiatry \nOrder which needs to be removed= Hospital Admission Order\nOrder number= 414247\n\nBAC Name: Margaret A Mentakis\nDept: Surgery \nBAC Call Back:408-972-3000 ext. 70 8139\nUser Call Back:408-972-3000 ext  70 8139\nIf you need to reach a BAC spectra link number when calling from outside, you can call 408-972-3000 and then press 1 (for party extension) and then just key in the spectra link number or you can ask the operator to transfer you.',NULL,'',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(2696,0,'N',1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','',3899654,NULL,'The Interfacility Facility Transport order set needs to be modified for True Transfer Pilot',NULL,'OS',NULL,'Stage',NULL,'0','M','R','H','D','True Transfer',NULL,NULL,'','',NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,'NICE','Res','0','KPHC CN IP ORDERSETS',NULL,'End User Applications','KPHC Inpatient MD/CRNA/Midwife Content','Order Set - MD','','M','N','N',' ',NULL,'NR',' ','N','ISERV','0','0','0','0','0','0','0',NULL,NULL,'2009-08-14 12:10:48','2009-08-17 10:52:28','2009-08-17 12:00:00','2009-08-18 08:16:06','2009-07-30 12:24:55',' ','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','','',459,NULL,95,201,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-08-04 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-07-30 12:28:00','2009-08-04 10:21:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'The Interfacility Facility Transport order set needs to have a sentence removed for the Man/Mod true transfer pilot, see attachment for details.

Requires further investigation. Based upon Tina HH email 8/12/09, the following details and questions are added for discussion.\n\nDr. Rudow suggests that the BPA display generic text (group needs to define): \nFor example, \"This patient has had a spinal/epidural insertion and anticoagulants may be contraindicated. <Display the details of the spinal/epidural timing order indicating date/time and meds/dose if entered>. Please refer to this link to review exclusion criteria prior to ordering or administering anticoagulants.\"\nThe BPA is generic\nThe time/date and med/dose details of the \"spinal/epidural\" timing order are shown (is it possible to extract details from the order into the BPA?)\nContains a link to a document that provides the exclusion criteria as shown in orders #1, #2 and #3 (is it possible to insert a link into a BPA?)\n\nRefer to SR 3849861 for text imbedded in each of the \"do not give orders\". (Will there be 3 links or 1?)\n\nWhat are the criteria for the BPA?\nThe spinal/epidural timing order has been entered\nThe \"do not give\" order(s) have been entered\n\nWhat is the trigger for the BPA?\nNursing will see the BPA when; attempting to administer anticoagulants from the MAR. The BPA would not be specific to particular drugs or doses, but class \"anticoagulants\" (see drug list included in current BPA, needs to be verified)\nPharmacy will see the BPA when: verifying anticoagulant medication orders, class \"anticoagulants\" (see drug list included in current BPA, needs to be verified)\nPhysician will see the BPA when: entering/signing anticoagulant orders, class \"anticoagulants\" (see drug list included in current BPA, needs to be verified)\n\nNote, the DO NOT GIVE orders will appear on the PER\n\nWhat turns the BPA off?\nThe Anesthesiologists will need to DC the \"do not give\" orders when rounding. Until the anesthesiologist DCs the order, it will continue to fire upon the triggering events above.\nDownside: when all 3 \"do not give\" orders are defaulted, the ANES will need to DC all 3 to turn the BPA off\nUpside: information from all of the BPAs is available\nIt does not appear that it will be possible to logically time the BPAs to fire during a specific time period since the timing varies depending upon type of procedure and medication dose/frequency ordered.\n\nWill the current BPA for \"do not give, epidural catheter\" continue to fire in addition to the ANES BPAs?<BR><BR>2009-08-12 - Tina H Hamilton - Reassiged to ORDERS BUS, note to Sherry Ellis, Stephanie Gavigan, Thomas Chun and Minh Nguyen (cc Mark Rudow and Maggie Mentakis) with details of above note.<BR><BR>2009-08-24 - Adam Huffman - Initial Approval: Adam J Huffman<BR><BR>2009-10-20 - Stephanie M Gavigan - WITS Build is in Progress.

Will have to double check with Dr Szeto on the creatinine cutoff before start building.  Based on his suggestion, this will require locator plus BPA-type build which will serve as an alert for pharmacists.<BR><BR>',984,974,NULL,NULL,NULL),(2732,0,'N',1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Elliot Morrison','',3978049,NULL,'OS New: Endometritis Order Set, see attached; Name of new orderset = \nChorioamnionitis/ Endometritis OB IP NCAL',NULL,'OS',NULL,'Stage',NULL,'0','L','N','H','D','',NULL,NULL,'','',NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,'NICE','Wor','0','KPHC CN IP ORDERSETS',NULL,'End User Applications','KPHC Inpatient MD/CRNA/Midwife Content','Order Set - MD','','L','N','N',' ',NULL,'NR',' ','N','PERN','0','0','0','0','0','0','0','2009-11-27 11:03:46',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-12-22 12:06:34','2009-08-24 11:06:17',' ','',NULL,'','',NULL,'per Robbie Zampa\r\n','','',1232,NULL,95,201,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-12-01 00:00:00','2009-11-18 00:00:00','2009-11-18 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-08-24 11:09:00','2009-12-01 09:29:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'(SR) MCH-PERINATAL-OS New: Endometritis Order Set named Chorioamnionitis/ Endometritis OB IP NCAL',NULL,'',NULL,NULL,'2009-08-24 - Robbie Zampa - Pending Requestor Information & Regional Approval<BR><BR>2009-11-18 - Robbie Zampa - Regional Approval.

Response from Dr. Marelich:\nMinh, the changes with the administration language in the D50W orders is ok. Ive filled in the other requested details for this change, below.\n\nNot to complicate things, but another matter has come up with these order sets (and the sliding scale insulin order sets, for that matter).\nIts the issue about the recognized positive bias (up to 40% in some samples) with fingerstick glucose readings from the point-of-care monitors, which we discussed at our ICU Directors-Mgrs meeting on 9/10. Because One Touch meters tend to read high in anemia - which could lead to unappreciated hypoglycemia - clinical experts from Endocrinology and Critical Care will soon recommend that patients on insulin or medications that can significantly lower glucose (insulin secretagogues such as glipizide) have One Touch  glucose meter results of < 80 mg/dL retested. Special patients at risk for hypoglycemia with fingerstick glucoses <80 are those unable to call for help when symptomatic, such as the very young, those with dementia, and those with altered levels of consciousness. \n\nThis is considerably different than our current hypoglycemia treatment threshold of \"less than 60\" on the Intensive Insulin order sets\n\nCurrently, our protocols state, \"Obtain serum glucose to confirm finger stick blood glucose greater than 500 mg/dL. \"\nWe could change this to read, \"Obtain serum glucose to confirm finger stick blood glucose greater than 500 mg/dL OR finger stick blood glucose less than 80 mg/dL with altered level of consciousness or dementia..\" This should be done for both low- and hi-dose intensive insulin protocols. \n\n(I dont think any of the pediatricians are using these protocols, thus Im not mentioning \"the very young\" in the proposed change language for these orders.)\n\nThis is somethiing of a patient safety issue, and it might certainly warrant action sooner than 10/27.\nWe might want to include similar changes to the other insulin order sets.\n\nSorry, thought Id bring this up at the same time.\n\n\nReply from Herb Szeto to Rick Dlott:\nRick,\n\nThe simplest thing for the med-surg ordersets would be to embed the serum test into the hypoglycemic  protocol which currently triggers at a glucose of 70.    Should we move the treatment threshold to 80 as well if we use 80 as the threshold for further testing?\n\nPurpose and background added to description.\n\n<BR><BR>2009-09-15 - Gail L Gordon Gaskins - Hello All, \nIf you want to go ahead with this change, this turns into a high level of governance requiring HCG approval.

But I was wondering if I can put in a request for possible modification.  As I mentioned before, Drug Use Management is working on an initiative focusing on the preferential use of NPH insulin first for Type 2 diabetics.  In addition to Lantus, Levemir (insulin detemir) is another long-acting insulin analog that is available.  Its still more costly than NPH but its slightly cheaper than Lantus.  Levemir has been positioned as an alternative to NPH for Type 2 diabetics who experience significant hypoglycemia on NPH.  This order set appears to be focused on Type 2 diabetics so I was wondering if the physician lead and/or decision support group would consider adding Levemir as an option in the order set.<BR><BR>2009-09-22 - Tina H Hamilton - TIGR review, high level change, adding new med choice.

I followed up with Dr. Szeto, and we do not want to remove the hardstop to order or document contraindication to Beta Blocker.  Please see Herbs comments below.  \nThanks again for connecting with us!\nJane\n\nSorry- further clarification around the b-blocker issue,  I think that it would be better to keep the section as required along with the updated warning for hypotension/shock.  If patients do not get started on B-blockers at admission or we dont document a contriaindication, there is significant risk that this will result in a core measure fallout for B-blocker at discharge.  There is no other way to reliably remind the provider to start a b-blocker prior to discharge other than the discharge instruction link that is not used consistently.  I hope that removing the IV metoprolol from the section would minimize the risk of complications.\n\nAnne Chang states that Rob Norris was to submit additional reasons for lytic delay, due 10/1.

It would also be helpful if there was some context included in the annoucement.

So the order to DC when pt leaves PACU is misleading. JC confirms that the orders (including the rflumazenil and narcan) will be discontinued by the RN at the end of the procedure. If meds are subsequently needed, the RNs can override in Pyxis.<BR><BR>2009-12-16 - Tina H Hamilton - OK, approved by Herb Szeto\nScheduled for 1/26/10 pending build team QA of change comm<BR><BR>',1378,991,NULL,NULL,NULL),(2789,0,'N',1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','',4122376,NULL,'DSA Request to Update all Stroke ordersets to comply with recently released AHA guidelines',NULL,'OS',NULL,'Stage',NULL,'0','L','N','H','S','',NULL,NULL,'','',NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,'NICE','Pla','NEUR','KPHC CN IP ORDERSETS',NULL,'End User Applications','KPHC Inpatient MD/CRNA/Midwife Content','Order Set - MD','','M','N','N',' ',NULL,'NR',' ','N','MEDSURG','0','0','0','0','0','0','0',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-12-22 12:06:47','2009-10-06 16:30:04',' ','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','','',984,NULL,95,201,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-10-06 07:20:00','2009-11-09 01:25:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'DSA Request to Update all Stroke ordersets to comply with recently released AHA guidelines/ \n\nPlease make the following changes: 1) Current guidelines indicate that patients at high risk for stroke need medications.

Anesthesia MDs on the previous night should not be creating orders for patients they have not seen and will not operate on.

Justification: Enables an initial start time to populate the MAR and will be flagged by the system as OVERDUE if not given.\n2.	Justification: Reduces the potential for nursing confusion between the loading bolus and the adjustment bolus.\n3.	Justification: Reduces the potential for miscommunication between physician, nurse, and pharmacist and reduces the risk of nurses giving the \"Adjustment Bolus\" in lieu of a \"Loading Dose\". Compliance with NPSG 3E.\n\nImpact/Risk of\nNot Making Change:\nHeparin drip order sets (cardiac and non-cardiac) current language frequently leads to risk of errors. While the heparin loading doses are NOT part of the High Alert Medication Program, the potential risk from loading dose errors is significant.\n\nthis request was approved via local cross functional domain, Adult domain and kphc leadership Daniel Burgoon and IP Pharmacy Director Susan Lasell\n\nPlease see screen shot under assessment tab\n\nrelated to 2983221, 4168158',NULL,'',NULL,NULL,'2009-10-07 - Deltese L Duncan - 09/30/09 SR Review Meeting: This change request requires Clinical Issues workgroup review.  \n\nLisa/Ashley to follow up.<BR><BR>2009-10-26 - Tina H Hamilton - Herb Szeto sent email to Hunter Burgoon:\nAny changes to the heparin orders would need to be vetted by multiple stakeholders before it makes its way to the Adult Service Domain and then the HCG.  The best approach at this time would be to provide screenshots of the parts of the orderset that you want to change and provide some background and detailed reasoning behind the request.  It needs to be clear enough so that we can send it out to the relevant stakeholders for review and comment.  Judging from the limited description below, it sounds like the request is  being made to move away from a protocol order for the loading dose.  If this is the case, you should be very clear as to the expectations of the physician and pharmacist in determining dosage.  The new Joint Commision measure specifically require that UFH dosing and monitoring be determined by \"defined parameters such as a nomogram or protocol\".<BR><BR>2009-10-27 - Sherry Ellis - TIGR Review:  Per regional domain.

Also, no need to create an order simply reminding nurses to keep wires from detaching. (Note, this procedure is also done at SAC so Ivan can follow up with Kamran Sahrakar to see how pts are managed via KPHC.)\nFor The Spinal Cord Stim Trial Implant Order Set we can use the Standard admission HBS IP NCAL ? 414104  \n    Remove under medications: Do not give Benzodiazepines, do not give narcotics\n    Add to Nursing section:  Ensure that spinal cord stim cords/cables do not detach from patient\n\nThis is being cancelled since KPHC order sets are not used to enter allergies, this is primarily an OP management issues, selected pts should not receive the meds listed but MDs forget to enter in the Allergies field;  IP ordersets wont accomplish the need. \nFor the Deep Brain Stimulator Implant we can use the same Standard admission HBS IP NCAL ? 414104  \n   Add to allergies section: The patient has been instructed he/she should avoid Droperidol, Reglan, Compazine, Tigan, Phenergan, Haldol, Serpasil,and Prolixin as these will all exacerbate his Parkinsons irreversibly.

We asked for the removal of the question altogether we we wrote these ordersets and never got a satisfactory reason of why it is required.  The result level that triggers a call for a critical value is independent of whether the patient is on warfarin and Im not aware that the lab processes the speciment any differently based on the answer.  In any case, we probably need to understand why this question is being asked in the first place to address Phils comment.  Id personally prefer - On warfarin and No warfarin therapy since it would include everyone, but can live with the current options if it means not having to go back through HCG.\n\n\n\n\nRationale per Philip Lee\n\nthis is certainly ok for all order sets that I work on/am responsible for.\n\nthe term \"no anticoagulants\" may be misleading...what they really mean is \"not on warfarin\"....however, they could be on other anticoagulants like lovenox which does not affect the INR...and it is still appropriate to check that button.\n\ni think it is fine re: PT/INR orders.\n\nwe should not be ordering any aPTT labs anymore. it has been my intent to review order sets with aPTT to see if most (if not all) can be removed).\n\nin KPNC, we no longer use aPTT to follow heparin dosing...rather, anti-Xa assay for this. as a result, no baseline aPTT needs to be drawn either.\n\nthere is a rare time that we will check a baseline aPTT in evaluation for hypercoagulable state, but this is relatively uncommon and can be ordered ala carte when needed.',NULL,'1260307365ï££W508677ï££Status changed to WorkInProgress as Task CHG000004284081 has begun work.ï£¢',NULL,NULL,'2009-02-11 - Tina H Hamilton - PMO notes imported\nAs shown on HCG approved changes for Arrythmia ED orderset.

It looks to me like it crosses the interface and gets picked up and presented with returned results.  Thus on the patient below I can see the result of the PT/INR and that the patient is anticoagulated on warfarin.  This is probably a good thing, so we dont have to search elsewhere for this important info. \n\nI recommend that we ask Herb to do what the ED has done and have orders that fill in the 2 most common options so the docs do not get stopped and have to - those would be PT/INR Baseline and PT/INR on Warfarin.\n\nSee my screenshot below to see what I am talking about on the results side.

Tom Lorey can give formal approval if that is what is needed by whatever process he feels is necessary here.  I think that if Herb and the ED Suite lead (cannot remember his name right now) agree, then probably worth doing this for all.  Tom Lorey the regional lab director is now leading the lab group and I am a part of his team, so I do not want to overstep here.\n\n\nI agree with Tom - baseline or none is probably best.  Maybe \"baseline\" is not so bad because it is fairly noncommital and would be closest to the idea of \"no warfarin\".

I havent had time until now to review and update the order set. \n\nMinh:  The insulin pump order set is based on the carb counting order set already in place with adjustments in order to use it in pump patients. Enclosed is an updated version of the insulin pump order set. The insulin pump order set has been approved by the Regional Endocrine group.   Please see my comments in green below.\n\nAs part of the insulin pump orders, I also wanted to include the contraiindications under the Notes section in the orders:\n\nNOTES\nNote:\n  Use this order set only for insulin treated patients who are using the insulin pump for insulin therapy\nCONTRAINDICATIONS TO PUMP THERAPY\n*Patient with altered state of consciousness\n*Critically ill patient (e.g. sepsis, trauma) requiring intensive care\n*Patient at risk for suicide\n*Patient refuses or otherwise unable to participate in own care\n*Family member, friend, or significant other refuses or is otherwise unable to \n      participate in care if patient is unable to participate in own care\n*Other circumstances identified by the physician\n\nPamela Kershner, M.D.\n\n\n\nNancy Ichiuji/CA/KAIPERM\n05/08/2009 08:15 AM	\nTo\nMinh Nguyen/CA/KAIPERM@Kaiperm\n\nRe: Fw: continuous SUBQ insulin pump\n	\nThe SFO Diabetes Management Group has been working on a P&P and an order set for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). Dr Pamela Kersher from WCR has been working on a REGIONAL order set. I have cc her as well.\n\nI have attached the drafts of our P&P and order set\n\nTo answer your questions:\n1.  Are you looking to start the patients on the pump in house?  \nNo -  only patients who are on insulin pumps at home will be continued on insulin pumps in the hospital  \nYes, but rarely (we purchased a pump for the hospital).  We have started a few patients on the pump but they have usually been patients who have been hospitalized for a long time with unpredictable blood sugars and this was the only way we could stabilize their sugars well enough to be able to discharge them.\n2.  Are the patients to use their own pump?  If so, do you have (not sure if needed) a policy around this?\nPatients will use their own pump and provide all necessary equipment (pump, batteries, tubing). Patient will sign an agreement with conditions for using the pump. See attached  P&P and agreement.\nAgreed.\n3.  Are the patients doing their own pump programming?\nPatients will determine their insulin dose based on the doctors orders ( __ units of insulin per gram of carbs). Doctor will include the basal rate and correction dose in the order set.\nThe pump is usually programmed to their outpatient settings.  Any changes in basal as well as correction doses or carb ratios will have to be ordered by the MD and then either the diabetes RN (if available) or the patient can make the dose changes in the pump.\n\nWe currently do not have a consistent practice for use of the insulin pump. When patients are admitted with an insulin pump, they were usually switched to an insulin sliding scale. However, we recognize that maintaining the patient on the insulin pump while in the hospital may be beneficial; therefore, we need to develop guidelines for use of CSII. Your help in developing an order set will be greatly appreciated!\n\n<BR><BR>2009-05-11 - WSSTARTEAM - This SR is not configured to sync with StarTeam.

He noted that there were some weight considerations in other cephalosporins which may have some implications   He agreed to go back to the ID chiefs to either get decision support or a firm recommendation.  The ICU Chiefs and managers would prefer to have the 2 gram option with or without decision support.

New os #3022.  Reviewed with Sherry 8/6/09, her question is how does phy know the CIWA score?  Provided one suggestion to build an order and have a smart link to pull in the CIWA score from doc flow sheet.

Build team and pharmacists to coordinate finalization of build with domain and Brian Hoberman in sync with milestone dates for production.<BR><BR>2009-08-14 - Tina H Hamilton - Screen shots exchanged between Minh Nguyen and Herb Szeto. Dr. Szeto requests that this be released when new functionality allowing collapsible sections is available (1/10). Changed HCG date to 12/16/09 with tentative planned end/release date 1/27/09 assuming technical feasability.<BR><BR>2009-08-14 - Jeremy D Vang - 8/11/09 - Per Dr. Szetos comment around the rebuild (sytle2) \"I prefer style 2.

Also, asked him to see if he prefers the ideal release date in November or December.<BR><BR>2009-09-30 - Jeremy D Vang - 9/30/09 - Dr. Szeto wanted to see screen shot of the orderset for distribution.  Sent him screen shot.  Dr. Szeto replied and request for web link.  Per Minh replied, \"With the revisions, the revised CIWA order set will be completely different from the current one.  So we treat it like a brand new build.  We will retire the current one when this new build is released. The dosing per CIWA a lot simpler and were able to incorporate all needed information within the orders.  So we thought that there is not a need for a protocol.  Basically the RN will know what dose to give based on CIWA score.  Perhaps the nursing member of the domain can take a look.\"\n\nAlso, made minor changes to ACTIVE ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL TREATMENT ONLY(CIWA score less than or equal to 8). In decision support change from \"BOTH\" to \"ALL\", added MEASURE VITAL SIGNS order w/ \"Every 4 hours\" in comment, and added verbiage to SPECIAL OBSERVATION VITAL SIGNS in comment with, \"Initiate and adjust Benzodiazepine dose according to CIWA Score.

Historically, CK and CK-MB have been the markers used. In 2007, the Joint European Society of Cardiology-ACC-AHA-World Health Federation Task Force established troponin as the biomarker of choice for this purpose. The KPNC Acute Coronary Syndrome Team has also adopted this perspective.\n\nAs such, in general, the order sets should be reviewed to see where it is appropriate to replace the orders for CK and CK-MB, with troponin. This is especially relevant for post-surgical patients where there is a greater likelihood that elevations in CK and CK-MB are the result of skeletal muscle injury rather than myocardial injury. For some cardiac patients, it is reasonable to leave the option of ordering CK and CK-MB since this may supplement \"sizing\" of an MI (when used in conjunction with troponin I measurement).\n\nElimination of aPTT or PTT orders as a \"routine\" baseline measurement OR as a method to monitor efficacy of heparin:\nRequest is to review all ordersets and remove the aPTT and PTT orders as obtaining this baseline is no longer clinically useful (except in the case of clinical concern about hypercoagulable state....on ordersets specific for that, leave the aPTT or PTT orders, though should change to ONE standardized way of naming it: either aPTT or PTT).   In KPNC, we NO LONGER use PTT to adjust heparin dosing. Rather, we use anti-Xa. \n\nAs a reflex (ie fall back to previous practices), physicians routinely check off PT/INR and PTT for many patients (e.g. preop, on admission to hospital, etc)....in case heparin might be used later. There is no value in checking baseline PTT (or anti-Xa for that matter) prior to initiation of heparin.',NULL,'',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(2832,0,'N',1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','',3521927,NULL,'addition of a \"DELAY IN ANTIBIOTICS\" order to the Pneumonia ED orderset and Pneumonia HBS orderset',NULL,'SR',NULL,'Stage',NULL,'0','L','N','H','S','',NULL,NULL,'','',NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,'NICE','Clo','0','KPHC CN IP ORDERSETS',NULL,'End User Applications','KPHC Inpatient MD/CRNA/Midwife Content','Order Set - MD','','L','N','N','A',NULL,'NR',' ','N','0','0','0','0','0','0','0','0',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-09-22 11:06:02','2009-08-28 12:16:43','2009-10-28 09:08:42','2009-04-05 09:46:27',' ',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','','',1018,NULL,313,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-10-28 09:08:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'addition of a \"DELAY IN ANTIBIOTICS\" order to the Pneumonia ED orderset and Pneumonia HBS orderset.

Limit to Pneumonia ED NCAL.\n\n-Rob<BR><BR>2009-02-10 - Yoko Olsgaard - Comment from Dr. Cavalier (Peds and PICU Domains) \nIf the Sputum induction order is a distinct order and can be ordered a la carte, it does not need to be put into the Peds Ventilator orderset but if it is NOT a la carte it needs to be put in the new Cystic Fybrosis Orderset that the Peds Regional Domain is working on right now.<BR><BR>2009-02-10 - Yoko Olsgaard - Adding to Comment from Dr. Cavalier - if it is not a distinct ordre that can be added a la carte, it also needs to be added tot he Peds Ventilator OS.<BR><BR>2009-02-11 - Yoko Olsgaard - NICU Domain Meeting results - not needed for NICU domain.  Not used enough.<BR><BR>2009-03-09 - Tina H Hamilton - email from Yoko Olsgaard:\nApproved to add to both the new Cystic Fibrosis OS, and to the PEDS Ventilator OS with the following correction for Pediatric patients. \n\nApproved with one change requested. \n\nDr. Albin Leong (Pulmonary/Allergy Pediatrics SAC) thought 15mL saline to induce is too high. 20ccâ€™s of 7%. \n4-5 mlâ€™s seems more appropriate according to SCL. This was verified with a phone call to SCL colleagues. \nDr. Brugger to forward Dr. Albin Leongâ€™s email to Tina. \n\nThe thought was that the volume of saline was based on adult doses. \n<BR><BR>2009-03-09 - Tina H Hamilton - email from Emily Foo to Sherry Ellis forwarded to goverance:\nHi Sherry and Sean, \n\nI dont believe there is a standard dose recommended for the induction.  The hypertonic saline is delivered as an aerosol via a nebulizer.  Hypertonic saline comes in 3%, 7%, and 10%.  The 3% and 10% comes in 15 mL container which would probably work if set as the default dose volume.   I would assume there would be a local protocol at each facility for RT to follow for the induction process.  (Perhaps adding some verbiage \"per local protocol\" might help?) Received BEFORE pedi domain clarification. \n<BR><BR>2009-03-10 - Tina H Hamilton - email Albin Leong, re: Pedi dosing\nSeparate email forwarded to cced list.  Let me know if more info is needed.   The Hyper-Sal comes as 4ml vials of 3.5% and 7% (the 7% is the usual dose for CF patients on chronic mucus clearance using this therapy, who use 1 vial=4cc bid).  Our pharmacy carries a 3% that comes in 15ml vials.  For CF patients and the CF order set, the order should be for 7% hypertonic saline (Hyper-Sal) 4ml (this is in the outpatient pharmacy list).\n\nDan,\n\nThanks for keeping me in this loop!  I think this would be appropriate for our CF patients, but with modifications.  The following would be the modifications:\n\n1)  We would ordinarily use the unit dose (4ml) of 7% hypertonic saline for this purpose.  Also, the volume listed, 15 ml is not commonly used, even for adults, so Im wondering where that volume in the order came from.\n2)  I would keep the 3% hypertonic saline (we use this in our bronchiolitis patients), especially for infants or those CF patients who havent use hypertonic saline before.  (Again, the unit dose vial is 4cc)\n3)  The \"Sputum culture\" should be listed as \"Cystic Fibrosis Respiratory Culture\" (Code 87070Q)<BR><BR>2009-03-10 - Tina H Hamilton - TIGR review, confirmed list of impacted ordersets; Early goal directed therapy OS listed under both ED and ICU since it is used in both settings.

Emily and Sherry to coordinate adding both adult and pedi screen shots to the single change communication, to be sent to domains for approval, then review/comment.<BR><BR>2009-05-20 - Sherry Ellis - Spoke with Janet Margolis about this request.  I told her that we could request a new EAP record that could route to the RT inbasket for \"sputum induction\".  The hypertonic solution and lab would need to be ordered by the physician on the order set.  The RT would need to look on the MAR for the hypertonic solution, and on the PER to see what lab test was ordered.  Janet stated she was going to be in Fremont today and would discuss this with the requester \"Barbara Sheldon\" and get back with me later today.  I left a voice message and email for Tracy Lee (coder) to provide the appropriate CPT code for \"sputum induction\" so I may make a request for new EAP from CMT.<BR><BR>2009-09-15 - Tina H Hamilton - TIGR review, no record of response to last comment posted. Left phone message for Janet Margolis to call Sherry Ellis re: RT agreement with suggested EAP and workflow. \nPlan, this will require RT peer and domain agreement on workflow and changes.<BR><BR>2009-09-15 - Sherry Ellis - Spoke with Janet Margolis and Barbara Sheldon about this request.  Discussed the proposed workflow for this request.  Barbara Sheldon is requesting updated screen shots of proposed smart group to discuss with the Respiratory Therapy Leads meeting October 9th.  She understands that my recommendation is to embed a smart group within specialty/ selected order sets vs. her original request for a stand alone order set (for 2 orders).  After agreement from Barbara S. after her October 9th meeting, it will be necessary to vet this request among HBS, ICU, and ED domain groups.  Then I will need to request a new EAP record that says \"Request RT to perform Sputum Induction\" this will route to the \"respiratory section\" of the PER (after consultation with Stephanie Gavigan we are unable to route it to the nursing comm section) with a frequency of per comments so Nursing may release this order if they are unable to obtain a sputum specimen and it will route to the RT inbasket pool.  The orders for hypertonic saline cannot be pre selected because a clinical decision needs to be made if the patient has Pneumocystis (for 3% solution), the details of the hypertonic saline orders should be as needed one time for sputum induction.<BR><BR>2009-09-15 - Sherry Ellis - Sent new screen shots today.<BR><BR>2009-11-05 - Sherry Ellis - Sent email to Barbara Sheldon and Janet Margolis inquiring to the status of this request following their Oct 9th regional RT meeting.<BR><BR>2009-12-02 - Sherry Ellis - Recieved email from Janet Margolis and Barbara Sheldon on 11/24/09 with further enhancements to SR per Dr. Maurice Franco.  Replied to email today advising them that the number of sputum collections is done at the order level as well as the hour frequency that they would like (see attachement dated today).  If additional respiratory micro labs are desired, Janet (or site support) to update this SR with requested labs.  THH will then forward request to domain leads (HBS, ED , ICU) and direct questions to Janet and Dr. Franco.<BR><BR>2009-12-02 - Tina H Hamilton - Screen shots and list of labs sent to domain leads for a final approval of labs per each order set.

Copied Nancy Aye and Craig Baker, CL, as heads up for java build and their input/questions/recommendations now.<BR><BR>2009-01-20 - Tina H Hamilton - removed obsolete attachment and replaced with 2 new files.<BR><BR>2009-02-03 - Tina H Hamilton - TIGR review; duplicate SR 3326655 resolved. Notes copied into details and summary. Reviewed past comments. Forward to Nancy Aye and Craig Baker for programming. Build team to explore placement of link in KPHC (MAR toolbar, PER, etc??)\n<BR><BR>2009-02-05 - Tina H Hamilton - Resent email to Brian Hoberman and Lisa Rohr requesting recommendations for how nurses will access link (MAR toolbar?).\nCopied Mark Knoblauch and Sherry Ellis<BR><BR>2009-02-05 - Tina H Hamilton - email Brian Hoberman\nThis belongs to Lisa and Bettianne. I support it.<BR><BR>2009-02-11 - Tina H Hamilton - Discussed with Lisa Rohr, Ruth Amos is the KPHC PICU nursing expert involved. All agree that adding the order to the orderset and the nurses will review and print from the PER is the immediate pathway. Longer term desire would be to add to MAR toolbar, which would make the Pedi Emergency medications dosing calculator available in all settings where pedi patients may present for care (ED, PeriOp, sometimes on Adult floors, etc.) This will require review and approval across domains and can be added later. Do not delay work on adding the order to the Pedi ordersets now.<BR><BR>2009-02-17 - Tina H Hamilton - TIGR review, needs EAP record for nursing communication order. EAP record has been ordered. Pending URL and Pedi domain nursing documentation of expected workflow. Plan, once URL  and workflow are available, to draft build and using Pedi domain description of workflow, circulate for review and comment. THis will print from PER. Using MAR toolbar is not the immediate scope.<BR><BR>2009-03-05 - Yoko Olsgaard - Following a long string of emails discussion rounding options, Craig released a test URL for the calculator. \nFinal decision was to calculate to 1 decimal place except where the rounding would cause some doses to be = zero - in which case the rounding will be carried out to 2 places.  Where an incorrect weight is entered (max is 100 kg) the calculator will set all calculated fields to zero until a correct weight is entered.  The calculator can be viewed and tested at this URL: \nhttp://cl-qa-new.crdc.kp.org/pkc/ncal/clib/tools/peds_emergency_meds_calculator/pediatric_emergency_meds_calculator.htm\n\nThis will be reviewed at the March 9 Pediatric Domain meeting.<BR><BR>2009-03-05 - Yoko Olsgaard - Ernest U has offered additional clarification regarding the Pediatric Emergency Meds Calculator.  The restriction on disallowing an inputted weight greater than 100 kg has been removed.  It is not the weight that is restricted but rather the maximum dose that is restricted.  Coding has been added to prevent the medications from exceeding their maximum dose limits regardless of what weight is inputted. \n\nThe calculator can be accessed at this URL:\n\nhttp://cl-qa-new.crdc.kp.org/pkc/ncal/clib/tools/peds_emergency_meds_calculator/pediatric_emergency_meds_calculator.htm<BR><BR>2009-03-09 - Tina H Hamilton - Nancy Aye requesting business testing and sign off, what is the process/\nemail sent to Nancy Aye re: governance steps. Domain leads (MD/nursing) approval is needed for the next steps to include review and comment of test link. Comments to be collated and sent to domain leads, could lead to additional java changes.\nRequested that Jon Feldman, Stevan Cavalier, Dan Brugger (and a nursing rep) provide approval for next steps with background/comment following their meeting.\n\n(Note, emails re: URL include references to ETT calculation. Dan Brugger requests that the meds dosage calculator not be delayed awaiting ETT. Need domain to signal when the current version is done.)<BR><BR>2009-04-06 - Tina H Hamilton - 3/31/09 Yolanda Lassiter assigned lead for testing. To coordinate with domain and testing team.<BR><BR>2009-05-04 - Tina H Hamilton - email from Yolanda Lassiter to domain leads:\nI am checking to see if we are ready to move forward with the Pediatric Emergency Meds Calculator?  The calculator was recently tested by an ED MD and RN, both have signed-off on the functionality. I understand most of you have tested the calculator as well.\n\nJon Feldman email:\nThis looks good to me.  But, Ernest U is much better at troubleshooting than I am.  Please do not release until you have clearance from him.\n\nErnest U email:\nPlease move forward.  Every drugs and defibillator settings in the web version are calculating according to our current Excel version.  I had also looked at the formula parameters (calculating dose and max dose) being used in the web script to be consistent with ours.\n\nFor reference, attached is the formula grid that detailed our current version. (attached)<BR><BR>2009-05-04 - Tina H Hamilton - Request for background/context from Jon Feldman. Next steps, review and comment once communicaiton is created.\n<BR><BR>2009-05-04 - Tina H Hamilton - Per Jon Feldman\nThere should be links to this reference in every PICU and Pediatric admit order set and every Pedi Procedural Sedation OS.  There are probably some ED and Anesthesia OSs that should have this link too.<BR><BR>2009-05-04 - Tina H Hamilton - Background/context received, see description<BR><BR>2009-05-04 - Tina H Hamilton - email Craig Baker\nCurrently the calculator is on the Clinical Library QA server.  This server is not accessible to the general Kaiser clinician population (unless youre given the direct URL to access the file as has been done during this testing).  Now that sign-off has been received, I will publish the calculator to the Clinical Library Production server.

Can we get into this on the Pedi and/or PHBS content calls today and/or tomorrow?  We should have (at least) Dr Feldman and pedi pharmacy representation on the call.  Also, since SAC/ROS has done a lot of work around the subject, and is the origin for many of the comments, someone from there should sit in too.  Im pretty sure we will need more time than well have (theres a pre-existing agenda), and likely will need to set up a workgroup to address the issues later on.  \n\nStevan\n\nBecause of this, we are pulling this from the June HCG until all issues are resolved.<BR><BR>2009-11-25 - Tina H Hamilton - Per Ruth Amos via email, PICU domain discussed this past week and will want a \"toggle link\". Sent email to Dan Brugger and Alice Hanson to provide details of approval, order sets to be added to, etc. Also, request domain AC to update Remedy  ticket with approval details.<BR><BR>2009-11-30 - Robbie Zampa - Updated Summary Description adding MCH PED/PICU descriptor<BR><BR>2009-12-02 - Tina H Hamilton - email from Dan Brugger, Ruth Amos\nThe Emergency Medication Sheet has been approved by Peds and PICU.  It incorporates both Broselow and PALS versions that will need to be selected by the user\n<file received, see attachment EMS Brpselow v2.3.xls)\n\nIt should go in as a link to the MAR with an order for the RN to \"Select Broselow or PALS as per facility standard, enter the patients weight in kilograms, print out and place at the bedside on admission.\"\n\nThese are the order sets recommended:\n\nPeds Standard Admit\nPICU Standard Admit\nPeds Surgery Admit\nPeds Neurosurgery Admit\nPeds Head & Neck Admit\n<BR><BR>2009-12-02 - Tina H Hamilton - Description updated per Dan Bruggers email.

We are trying to track the usage of these documents from applications like KPHC and eConsult. Due to a bug in Internet Explorer, there is a possible workaround solution.

After discussion with nursing, this is felt to be a sufficient reminder to the nurses to give the loading dose. I.e., if they see the maintenance dose come up as due, they will not give it without checking that the loading dose was previously given. Worst case scenario, they get two maintenance doses, and should be close to same serum levels.\n\nElliot Morrison, MD\nOb/Gyn Santa Rosa\n707-393-4864\n8-533-4864<BR><BR>2009-12-17 - Robbie Zampa - Updated Descriptioin with Instructions as requested.<BR><BR>',1294,935,NULL,NULL,NULL),(2894,0,'N',1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','',4278389,NULL,'Day of surgery HAS ASC ORDERS orderset - Measure vital signs is showing \"PACU\" and it should be \"Preop\".',NULL,'OS',NULL,'Stage',NULL,'0','L','N','H','S','',NULL,NULL,'','',NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,'NICE','Pla','GYN','KPHC CN IP ORDERSETS',NULL,'End User Applications','KPHC Inpatient MD/CRNA/Midwife Content','Order Set - MD','','L','N','N',' ',NULL,'NR',' ','N','PERI','0','0','0','0','0','0','0',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-12-22 12:07:28','2009-11-24 11:01:50',' ','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','','',984,NULL,201,201,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00','1900-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2009-11-30 12:45:00','2009-12-03 09:09:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Day of surgery HAS ASC ORDERS orderset - Measure vital signs is showing \"PACU\" and it should be \"Preop\".\n\nThe request is to change the verbiage in order set 414286 (DAY OF SURGERY HAS ASC ORDERS GYN IP NCAL) underneath vital signs from \"per PACU routine\" to \"per Preop routine\".\n\nSee attached screenshot.',NULL,'',NULL,NULL,'2009-11-24 - Tina H Hamilton - SR created based on HD 5002533 which was closed for new SR creation.

In section for \"Call if\", Comments area:  CHANGE: all \"____\" items to \"***\" in order to reflect wild card entry hard stops for Providers. Approved by Domain for all \"____\" areas in this orderset to be a  wild card hard stop for Physicians.\n2.  The order for \"Measure Amplitude Integrated EEG for duration of cooling and rewarming\" can also be used as an a la carte order for aEEGs outside of this orderset.\n3. Body Cooling- Nursing Communication order section: some wording is not appropiate for NICU- this may have come from Adult OS. Need to reword for NICU specific patients.\na.  Nursing Comm order for shivering: discussion re: \"MD/NP\" notification. Per Dr. Fischer- consider \"MD\" only. Approved as currently written, since in OAK, NP and/or intern may be covering on night shift and can notify Attending MD once they are notified by the RN.\n4.  Esophogeal Probe insertion order- needs to be new KPHC order (Dan Brugger created SR 4240052 for this) vs. Nursing Comm order in order to be housed in appropriate area of PER for the RN. Dan Brugger checked with Build Team- should not be a delay to create this new order.\n5. Temperature Recording Section: Wording redundant with esophogeal probe temp order. May be difficult for RN to follow on PER. The following changes were approved:\na. LEAVE IN: \"RN to document time initiated\",  DELETE: \"hourly cooling device temperature.\"\nb.

Confirmed with Michelle Donnelly that the original request for a BPA has been converted to a smart group. (THis is the original request; BPA Antibiotics\n\nAntibiotics BPA\nThe BPA logic would be as follows:\n\nMD:  a BPA would fire if an MD signs an order for an antibiotic from the Pneumonia ED orderset if the patient has been in the ED 5 hrs 45 minutes or longer.  The alert should only fire for antibiotic medications ordered from this orderset, not any antibiotic.  When the alert fires, it should say:  \"\"Based on the length of time this patient has been in the ED, there is a potential for delay in antibiotic administration past 6 hours.  Would you like to document the Reason for Delay?\"\"  The alert would have the delay order in the window as an option for the MD to select, similar to how the lactate order appears if we order a blood culture w/o the lactate.\n\nRN:  there are two alerts Im thinking of-- one would fire when the RN acknowledges an antibiotic order in the PER if a patient has been in the ED > 6 hours-- alert would ask RN to remind/inform MD that the antibiotic is being given outside of the 6-hour window.  (Alternately, I wonder if such a BPA, if possible, could also allow the RN to document reason for delay via the order popping up for them, but its probably for the MD to actually document that).  The other BPA would fire when the RN acknowledges an antibiotic order if there is no blood culture done or ordered on the patient-- the BPA would remind them to do blood cultures first, and to make sure the correct culture and med admin times are documented.  Ideally these alerts would only fire for antibiotic orders that are from the Pneumonia ED orderset-- they should not fire for every antibiotic order.
